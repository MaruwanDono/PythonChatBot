The anti-circumcision movement has been called anti-semitic, the call to end honor culture has been called racist and the question about depression-related outcomes of same sex parrents has been called homophobic.

I see this in many of my own students.  It's a shame, because I can't make all the connections for you.  I have to teach what I have time for during my lectures.  I do my best at it, but there's significant time pressure. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The homework and other exercises are designed to help you connect up what you do in class.  I can't guarantee your institution does a great job of this, but mine does pretty well.  The best advice I can give you is to just keep at the material, and practice a lot.  With introductory math courses like calculus, repetition of doing things like integrals and derivatives are important.  Maybe if you're in calc 2, looking at a lot of sequences, series, and practicing parametrizing curves over and over again would be helpful. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It seems like students just think their instructors magically understand the stuff.  It's quite the opposite.  For me, I had many classes, mostly in physics, that built up my knowledge on calculus and mathematical methods for problem solving.  Just for example, you will do roughly triple the integration in calc 3 just by the sheer fact that most problems require you to do triple integrals rather than single.

First, follow the manual for your car. Some say 50,000 and some say 100,000. Those are when you should change it. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Replacing both fluids is a good thing. Over time they break down and/or pick up contaminants that can affect their chemistry causing problems. A good example was GM Dexcool and the plastic gasket they used. Under normal conditions over time the chemistry of the Dexcool changed slightly which causes it to attack the plastic on the gasket which made it brittle a prone to cracking. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ For radiator fluid it's cycled inside something with moving parts that wear and introduced metal dust into the fluid. Over time it also breaks down and looses it's lubricating and protecting properties and should be replaced eventually.
What? Are you serious?
This is a great shirt! I’m not big on jerseys and other team related apparel outside of hats, but this I could wear.
There's nothing that prevents health insurance companies from selling across state lines, you realize. That was just something Trump pretended was a revolutionary idea. The only reason insurance companies don't do that now is because you have to be licensed in the other state and follow whatever their state laws are, and it's not profitable to sell in that manner. It's only profitable if you can sell a subpar plan in a state where it would normally not be allowed.
I think it's Grenth. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ https://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gwwikia/images/a/a6/Avatar_of_Grenth_concept_art.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20080405071129

Isn't that just bringing it back to the original topic that this thread is calling out? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; I usually agree with you, and I do agree with being actively against Moore, but this comment seems a little hypocritical. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Please tell me how I'm wrong. This is exactly how this thread has played out and how other people are treating it. I'm sure that you've seen reaction threads when subreddits like this has drama, this is absolutely, positively par for the course. They're not being clever when they post them.

I don't think it says anything innate about them as a person, but it does likely provide some information on how they were perceived and treated by others during their formative years.
Thanks for the reply! The only reason it would be three months is so I can go in the 90 day visa waver programme, if I could get a visa to stay longer I would but I don’t think I would be accepted being an unemployed single graduate with no property! My thinking is that if I did three months doing the AT I would be more likely to be accepted for a six month+ visa in 2019 to do a PCT thru hike. I have considered just applying for the visa but it’s £160 even if you’re rejected and while I have that money I really don’t wanna just flush it on a risk like that.

I can tell you that void melee has the same max hit as bandos tassets/chestplate, neitiznot helmet, and barrows gloves. Void ranged offers a damage boost but armadyl is more accuracy.

Keep in mind all of this is with high 90+ stats in the relevant skill and at lower levels void lags behind in effectiveness.

*Baltimore Police are investigating an officer-involved shooting in South Baltimore. On Wednesday night, two officers noticed a man acting suspiciously and showing characteristics of a person armed with a gun. The officers approached Allen Hosea Johnson Jr. and attempted to get the gun, but the Johnson fought back. During a struggle between the officers and Johnson, one round was fired from the gun and shot an officer in the palm of his hand. According to Commissioner Kevin Davis, the second officer used his stun gun, was able to handcuff Johnson, and retrieve the gun. The officer, a three year veteran of the police force, was taken to Shock Trauma for a non-life-threatening injury. Davis says the officer is in good spirits and will be fine. Johnson is in custody and was taken to Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. Johnson has been charged with Attempted First and Second Degree Murder, Illegal Possession of a Firearm, Felony Assault Second Degree of a Law Enforcement Officer, as well as other firearm and drug-related charges.*

My grandma cares a lot that is true. It would be better. I know its dumb, like I'm not denying that here. My dad once said, go live at grandmas house, be just like your brother.

I don't want to be like that, if I had to choose between that and death, I'd choose the latter.
Defining 'left' is implicitly a difficult task. If anything I judge left/right as a metric of concern for workers vs concern for capital.  I feel that if a politician defends Israel against valid criticism they are doing it to gain corporate support since Israel is a key global-corporate ally (military industrial complex etc).  To me, that means they put capital above workers/people to an extent that I cannot label them as 'Left'.  That's just how I read the situation and it's a subjective judgement.  I don't really know why Thornberry is opposed to boycotts. I just think my reasoning above is the most likely explanation since I see the BDS movement as about the only thing that will force Israel to end their decades-old apartheid system and a valid 'criticism' of Israeli policies.

So much about dating as described on PPD only applies to the US. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ All this fuss made over how the man always has to pay for a date... never had a problem splitting the bill in the UK. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Formal dating in general for that matter is not really a thing anymore, either you go friends &gt; FWB &gt; relationship or you go out casually to see a movie or something then bang and see if you like each other.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ A lot of tradcons claim women these days don't want families, I dunno where they live but I've yet to meet any. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Religion is quickly dying in the UK so any religious aspect of the whole thing from the US certainly won't apply here. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The class issues discussed here certainly differ because to be truly upper class in the UK you need to be a fucking lord or a duke or something. Unless you come from the Royal Family you max out at UMC. And British MC-UMC culture is different to the US, because they essentially just act like they think aristocrats act, and they also tend to be champaign socialists because that's trendy. Both of those behaviours are due to envy of the UC they'll never truly be a part of. It's a weird thing to witness.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Anyway probably loads more I can't remember off the top of my head but yeah this stuff varies a lot by local culture.

&gt;Yes, he was a movie actor and a lot of the martial arts shown are staged with pulled punches. Despite that, we know he has won real fights and also taught martial arts. This at the very least suggests he's more than just a movie actor. Enough notable people have trained with him and vouched that he was the real deal that reducing him to just a movie actor is preposterous. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ LOL. The fact you're trying to argue that the myths and legends of his *supposed fights* are enough to prove him as a great fighter is a joke when you try to dismiss the video showing Bruce Lee's poor technique and punching fundamentals. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;We don't know what that video shows, because we don't know what he was trying to train. No context is given. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ We do know what it is, we see Bruce Lee working that bag and having poor punching form and technique. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;And this is why you are framing everything as a boxing problem in a boxing context. This is what you know. Boxing has rules and within those boxing rules, everything you said probably holds true. You can win a fight without ever punching someone in the face. In fact, I have seen multiple in-person fights where people were truly going for the kill and they started and ended with kicks. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dI998TEspM _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ What is this supposed to show? Bruce Lee fighting someone his size? Do I need to repeat how Mike Tyson in his prime was probably 80-100 lbs heavier than Bruce Lee, taller, longer limbs, and definitely more well versed and fighting than he ever was? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The fact you posted this video is absolutely ridiculous. I can tell you have never fought a real fight, nor have you probably seen what a heavyweight prime Mike Tyson does. It's like, you seriously think that Bruce Lee would be able to stand right there and counter punch/kick a better counter puncher who could eat his shots and slip them simple enough? Lee couldn't stop these guys from fighting back, and you really think he could do better against a bigger, faster, stronger, and better fighter? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;In the end, we are talking about something completely hypothetical. My claim is that weight class is not the final deciding factor in a fight to the death, that Bruce Lee is trained in a wider variety of martial arts and that he would have an advantage against Mike Tyson in that situation.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Your claim is wrong, and a joke. I'm telling you from someone who has ring experience and recognizes what power is vs. bigger and smaller fighters. You go to any professional fighter/trainer well versed with fighting at any MMA or Boxing gym, and they will straight up laugh in your face when you claim Bruce Lee has an advantage against Mike Tyson in any fight scenario involving them face to face without anything but their fists. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ You're probably one of those people who seriously thinks Bruce Lee would land the first punch/kick several times, all quicker than Tyson's first (LOL). _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ At the end of the day, you have no video evidence, nothing to show me Lee can stand up to this: _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBDsfGTQpdc _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Oh, and these are all men 6'0* / 210 lbs+ in fighting shape. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Last but not least, on one of his, *legendary fights*: _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;&gt;Individuals known to have witnessed the match include Cadwell, James Lee (Bruce Lee's associate, no relation), and William Chen, a teacher of T'ai chi ch'uan. Wong and William Chen stated that the fight lasted an unusually long 20–25 minutes.[42] Wong claims that he had originally expected a serious but polite bout; however Lee had attacked him very aggressively with intent to kill, straight from the beginning of the bout when he had replied to Wong's traditional handshake offer by *pretending to extend a friendly hand only to suddenly transform the hand into a four-pronged spear aimed at Wong's eyes*. Forced to defend his life, he had nonetheless refrained from striking Lee with killing force when the opportunity presented itself because it could earn him a prison sentence. The fight ended due to Lee's *unusually winded* condition, as opposed to a decisive blow by either fighter.[42] According to Bruce Lee, Linda Lee Cadwell, and James Yimm Lee however, the fight lasted a mere 3 minutes with a decisive victory for Lee. In Cadwell's account, *The fight ensued, it was a no-holds-barred fight, it took three minutes. Bruce got this guy down to the ground and said 'do you give up?' and the man said he gave up*.[41] _back_to_line_ A couple of weeks after the bout, Lee gave an interview claiming that he had defeated an unnamed challenger, which Wong says was an obvious reference to him.[42] In response, Wong published his own account of the fight in the Chinese Pacific Weekly, a Chinese-language newspaper in San Francisco, with an invitation to a public rematch if Lee was not satisfied with the account. Lee did not respond to the invitation *despite his reputation for responding with fists of fury to the slightest provocation* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ And you know what? If you still want to argue, go post on r/mma and ask them what they think. They should be unbiased/favor Bruce Lee, right? Let me know how many people you can find actually agree with you when you get laughed at. Maybe they'll be able to educate you better on this manner, since I'm kind of being an ass about this (and I do apologize on that regard). I'm sorry to crush your childhood dreams, but Bruce lee was a movie actor first and foremost. Not a fighter. He could have been a great fighter, in a lower weight class in MMA or Boxing, but he was never beating Mike Tyson at his best.
Read a book called The Millionaire Mind that surveyed millionaires, asking questions like this, among others. Rich doctors and lawyers emphasized grades/GPA more than other fields, unsurprisingly. Most millionaires did not inherit their wealth, most were college graduates, and their GPA on average was 2.9 _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;Some of the myths about these people are that they were all straight A students, scored at the top on the SAT, attended elite private schools, etc.  The average SAT score for the sample was 1190.  Their most frequent grade in both high school and college was “B.”  Their GPA in college was 2.9.  They typically did not qualify for admission to an “elite” college or university.  But there were a few who, in spite of their mediocre credentials, somehow made it into the freshman class of a prestigious college. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ http://www.thomasjstanley.com/2012/12/college-ranking-not-among-millionaires-key-success-factors/ _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ What I noticed though is that they often severely downplay the role of luck, and like to attribute their success more often to other factors like being well disciplined or having a strong marriage. In a separate book by Nicholas Nassim Taleb titled The Black Swan, he notes that for every successful millionaire, there's plenty just as disciplined or whatever else who fail simply because of bad luck.

This definitely has the look of *was on ambien,* however, and I don't even say this with *for ambien art* as a reference point, but I genuinely like it. It's actually put together quite well. Some of the shapes resemble things, and can't really be solidified as to what they are. However not only does it work here, but the way they are organized on the canvas is actually aesthetically very good. Like for real, if this was on a larger/better canvas, I'd honestly buy this.

Going to a therapist isnt starting HRT. The therapist isnt there to tell you what to do, they're there to help you figure it out for yourself.

If anything, its a nice place to offload your feelings, which I know as much as anyone else is not an easy thing to do. Hell, the concept alone is terrifying to me - but it is genuinely helpful in my opinion. Just my 2¢

OBJ, Terrell Owens, Ben Roethlisberger, Ray Lewis, Ezekiel Elliott is serving a suspension for beating his girlfriend and Micheal Vick fought dogs for christ sake, whats more universally hated than that? but he was welcomed back w open arms. And the point about his teammates not liking him isn't relevant at all, not sure if you watched or followed the NFL at all but it was clear most players and owners supported Kap.

I make no apologies for my complete lack of respect for unionism, yes I may be a big Fenian and want a united Ireland etc . _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Look, here's what happened.

He then suggested it's UKs problems they can deal with the border. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  I would respect unionism if they took on board the concerns of the taoiseach and said *look we understand the tensions of both our countries, we will do our absolute best to ensure the common travel area is upheld* and I wholeheartedly would say dead in unionism, show us your hand. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Instead, we get the following:.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Sammy Wilson dup: _back_to_line_ *HES MORE OF COWBOY THAN AN INDIAN*.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Lord kilcooney ex uup (in relation to coveny saying he would like to see a united Ireland in his life): Simon Coveney is stirring things up .

I haven't worked a *real job* in 5 years so I'm not worried about that. Last year I spent 6 months thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail. I'd spend that time traveling on the cheap. Lots of thru-hikes, lots of adventures in foreign countries where my USD goes a lot further. Basically, live life while I'm still young and able rather than wait until I'm old and rich.

The sad truth is we will have to resort to some type of physical conflict to prevent NK from developing nuclear ballistic missiles.  Diplomacy hasn’t worked, sanctions haven’t worked, and waiting hasn’t worked.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ What kills me is everyone is acting like US is pushing for war.  If that was the case, we would already have attacked after one of the nuke tests or the ballistic missiles fired over Japan, which would be more justification than we have gotten for past wars.  We can’t afford a war and we know it. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ We are simply answering threats of war with appropriate shows of force, in an attempt to deter an attack.  We haven’t fired a shot nor intend to fire a shot.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ What happens if someone calls in a bomb threat on a subway?

You can’t threaten to blow people up and then say the people you’re threatening to blow up are the bad guys. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ What is the alternate solution to this problem?

The difficulty I have with this approach is that there are so SO many ways to be complicit with and perpetuate systemic/institutionalized violence, and many of them are everyday ways of life for people who consider their own complicity as not that at all while seeing other specific configurations as the real problem. So like, it's easy to see how police are part of this horrific system, but in this broken system, the fabric of everyday life is so often dependent on living in ways that contribute to horrific egregious harm to others. Just because it's less visible doesn't mean it's less real. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Does that make sense?

Wow I'm actually a little shocked to learn Iron Man was 8 years after X-Men. I was aware that a lot of RDJ's appearances as Iron Man in other films were little more than short cameos. But it's still very interesting to see the similarities in their careers as far as these two roles are concerned. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Ever since Jackman mentioned Logan being his last, it's made me wonder how many films RDJ has left in him. But then again, I never realized he's been at it for 8 less years than Jackman. And RDJ still seems to love it. It also probably doesn't hurt that a decent amount of his film credits are for small cameos
I always leave then at home :(

pro tip: don't tell that to girls ever. at least not until you've slept with her. it's a turnoff for women to show affection that early. i mean, sure this is how it happens in the movies, but real life unfortunately is not like that at all. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ instead, be assertive, decisive, mysterious, calm, grounded, passionate and fun. have good eye contact and good tonality. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ it's good that you have the “not giving a fuck” mentality. there is an infinite amount of women - so what one says “no”.

I mean, it varies, but you may want to try talking about this with your prospective HRT provider.  If they very gradually shift your hormone levels, and keep them in the lower ranges of the gender you are transitioning towards, the effects should still occur but most likely at a much more gradual pace.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The only major concern you would really want to watch out for is having no dominant sex hormone, as this can cause a number of health issues after a while.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ There are a number of ways to play off or hide transitioning, however.  For a trans female, doing things such as binding, growing facial hair, and keeping a masculine haircut can help you be read as male. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Good luck!

Ware is a good player to use especially if you have some solid MLB options....if your running a 3-4 your outside LB should be able to hold up against the run which is what Ware was doing when Dallas drafted him in 05. He can also snag a pass no problem. Just get a good chem for him.
I don't think we even know how much ADA is in a block. So I don't think there is anyway to know what the rewards might be right now.
The evolution of their paywall systems from *pay for a fast pass to unlock everything, in case you don't have time or got into the game late* to *you can't get this or have a chance at winning and enjoying yourself unless you pay* is astounding. In BF4 it was fine since you could use any weapon and still do well which made the shortcuts unnecessary, battlefront pushed it towards an obvious money milking design, and this is outright deplorable.   _back_to_line_    _back_to_line_ I wouldn't be surprised if EA gets knocked down a few pegs over the next few years and licenses are moved to other studios if this continues. Eventually games like this just won't sell.   _back_to_line_    _back_to_line_ For how much they want you to sink into their sports games you could literally pick up a pricey hobby like paintball, snowboarding, or 3D printing/laser cutting.... that's fucked.

For one thing, I did say this in my previous post: *That's not to say that certain techniques aren't taken from those arts and used in the octogon, but the vast majority of techniques used in the UFC comes from arts like Muay Thai, boxing, wrestling, and BJJ.* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I myself incorporate techniques from arts like Taekwondo into my kickboxing. That doesn't mean that I think training TKD alone is a good idea. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ And I will never be impressed or convinced of an arts effectiveness by guys doing compliant drills on each other. Even if someone did win a street fight using something like Capoeira exclusively, that means nothing. Plenty of people win street fights with no martial arts training at all.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Throw an amateur who only does Capoeira or TKD into an amateur MMA match with an actual MMA fighter and see who comes out on top.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ And even if they do have things like face punches and low kicks, there are still aspects of those arts that are usually ineffective. For example, I consider Hung Gar to be among the best traditional style of Kung Fu. However, if a Hung Gar practitioner were to use low stances in a Muay Thai match, for example? He would be leg kicked into oblivion and kneed in the face. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Either way, traditional arts aren't always useless, although some pretty much are, like Tai Chi. However, they have such poor quality control, and elite fighters that come out of those arts are very few and far between. And they're only elite because they started training different arts. And even if they do train realistically, there are often big problems with the arts anyway.

As for some good high ends, Vigorous Chestpiece is good, Specialized backpack is good, nimble holster is good if you remember to use it, savage gloves are good. So until you get the exotic ninjabike backpack or a full set of classified gear, I'd recommend 4 set pieces and 2 high ends of your choice.

Dudes never been to india, clearly. I was very surprised at how modern New Delhi is aiming to be. I won't sugar cost it, some parts were run down incredibly, but other areas were really nice, and the real surprise was their rail system.

Gonna end this here. You clearly don't know what you're talking about.
I'll be happy to add to my thoughts in. There are a few different things to answer here so i'll do my best to touch on them all.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 1) Personally i have no issues with reviewer making money of doing reviews. I can tell you 1st hand how much work is involved in it if done right. it's a lot of work and time. for professionals it's how they make a living. Just because i choose not to take money for reviews doens't mean I think everyone should go that route. Reviewers of any product in any industry get paid for it. With that said, i have an issue if someone lets the money make their review biased and to be fair, it's gonna be hard to slam a product someone is paying you to review if that's your career. in terms of someone like me or you who work, it would be like telling your boss to fuck off. so I'm not a fan of the whole structure of companies paying directly to reviewers. I've been asked twice what's my fee for doing a review and both time's i answered *i don't take money for doing reviews* but again that's my choice. I would prefer of the money is made off donations, montization, affiliate links etc etc and not direct payment from companies. kinda like say video game reviewers. they don't get paid from game companies, they get paid from the publication they work for, who in turn makes money off selling advertising. even though though *giant bomb* situations can happen.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 2) Me personally i wouldn't accept money for anything review related. that's my choice. To me a reviewer works for the customers not the product makers. the job of reviewer is to provide the customer a fair assessment so they can use that information to pick a good product that suits their needs. As far as bumping things up in the que, i'm ok with it. I've done it before. had a company send me something and be like can you work on this as soon as you get it i really want to get the word out about this product. I'm willing to do that for sure and have done that. But not for money and only if it's feasible for me to do so. I don't do deadlines either. I've had companies try and rush me and i give them the same response. a review is ready when it's ready and the reason people like and trust my reviews is i won't sacrifice quality. I've never had them push me after that. they understand that. in the same sense remember these reps sending this products have bosses who want to see the review for the product they sent for free so helping a rep out by moving it up and getting their boss off their butt is more of a having a good relationship with the rep type of things. There are a few reps i believe i have a good relationship with and would consider them friends, and others that are more just business like in our relationship.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 3) beta testing is a bit of a tricky one. there is a definite split. i have a buddy who refuses to beta test without payment. I have other friends who do it just cause they are happy to do so. but those are usually the less qualified people. I seen a beta test happen where it was a group effort and the product came out mediocre but a few in the beta group did reviews praising it and shilled the fuck out of it. one in the group that now refuses to do beta's did a not so good review on it because he was being honest and the shill testers tried to pressure him to change his review which he did not do. it was an ugly situation. for me personally i say it's gray because it depends on the situation. I was asked to help design an RTA and i'm in the process of doing so. I was also compensated for it. I have the original still and they are working on the redesign based on my notes currently so i'm waiting for the v2. the same company asked me if i would test a chip for them as they are wanting to do a mod as well. I said i would and no compensation was discussed. so it kinda depends on the situation. if it's about me being part of a group and having my opinion asked i'd be willing to do it for free for sure. but if i'm actually designing the shit and the company stands to profit off of it, i do think i should be compensated, however with the right opportunity i would design for free as well. so really just depends on the situation i don't have a hard stance personally either way. I was also asked to beta an RDA from another company for free as well and i agreed and they never wound up sending it lol.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ as far as the feedback goes the way i see it, my reviews are feedback and i'm doing those for free anyway so i pretty much always offer free feedback on everything lol. companies can read them and sue the info freely. matter of fact ijoy seen my pd270 review on youtube and asked me about it and for feedback and i gave them advice and the updated 510 was similar to what i told them but still not right, however the PD1865 was fixed. I received no money for that but clearly i had some influence on them _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 4) I don't think it's wrong for a reviewer to be compensated fairly for a review as long as it doens't compromise the review, my only complaint is that when money is involved for most people it'll make them biased whether they realize it or not. money is a huge motivator for everyone hence why for me i wanted to leave money out of the equation. my question is at what part does a review become compromised. if it changes a no to a yes? sure that's obvious, but what about a reviewer who noticed an issue and said eh it's not a big deal i won't say it, but had they not been paid would have said it? i've noticed a lot of things about stuff that SHOULD have been said but wasn't and it makes me wonder if it was just missed, or if they decided not to bother because money. that's why for me even if something isn't a big deal, i'll still mention it and say i don't think it's a big deal, because someone else might think it is. I know reviewers who have done this and i'm not gonna say who or why they did, i'm just saying i know reviewers who noticed things i felt were a big deal and chose to point it out and they decided not to mention it because they felt it wasn't a big deal as most people wouldn't notice.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ for me i always try and be an open book to everyone

You obviously have a pretty hard slant for some reason, and you may well have run into some pretty bad groups, they absolutely exist, there's horror stories within the fandom as much as without, but you really obviously have some deep-seeded bias while ignoring the same elsewhere. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ This is the most hilarious shit I've read all week.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ So because other people are into shit that should otherwise be banned or illegal makes what you do ok?

In this case, it's more likely that since there was JUST an update, and you queued up during/around the patch rollout, the matchmaking didn't find enough people within that period and just put together whoever it could find.

So this is a circle jerk party? Either you love it or your out? Any real critisicm on any give title is forbidden? Its not like the sub goes through the same hype cycle with every mid+ sized game.   _back_to_line_ Whats the point os „experience as much of it“.. that sould like eating shit till you die..  instead of trying to paint a realistic view of the wuality of any game everything is beyond reasoning the greates vr title ever fucking released. But its not shortl after release the turd is dead no body talks about it anymore and jumps on the next hype train instead of maybe trying to give a realistic pov on the quality of a game and show the devs what needs work and does not fly very well its.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ One of the redditors here wrote he had issue with a game and was downvoted to hell because of course the next hypetrain does not allow any negative propaganda. So prople can not even talk about their issues and share their throught because a bafoon of complete idiots swamp even the slightes neutral discussion down. _back_to_line_ Do you think that is a healthy behaviour? Something that helps vr? To make it shine out of every ass instead showing the actual truth and let people discuss without bombardment of little egomaniacs who think they beed to defend a toy? Seriously? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I know that im pretty agressive at time with my choice of words but this is a choice not a state. If anyone digs out old discussion very early during the release of psvr there where actually meaningfull discussion happening without that much children onboard. Maybe the high price during relase limited that pool substancially. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Im all for more immersive and interactive vr games. The 100th shallow postcard wont push the format further.. the 50th rerelase of the same old neither. _back_to_line_ What does it help to the present in a fictional world thats dead and boring and makes you jump through hoops to interact with it properly. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ We need good vr games, tailormade for vr, not more average junk. Doom VR will sell, not on wuality but on brand recognition alone.  Big psvr pricecuts lead to a huge sales push. Now show the new guys the real diamonds on this platform instead of the same old hyped up junk.

Since you replied I'll give you my thoughts on this. PSN was once free. Since switching to paid service they have dramatically increased the quality of the online service while offering free games every month. Did they have to do that to stabilize their servers? No. But they did it because Microsoft was brining in a ton of revenue. This steady stream of revenue is important for console game platforms today. If it means they can improve the online then I think it's worth it. If they can give us a party system with voice chat on the Switch then a small yearly fee doesn't matter much to me, especially if I'm getting games to play with it. That being said I'm already invested in the Switch and would not miss out on online anyways.

Giving out higher speeds works well for both ISPs and consumers. For suers it maeans they get the data they want faster (less waiting), and for ISPs it means customers actually utilise the network for shorter periods of time. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ For example if you have five customers sharing 100Mbps you might say you can only offer each of them 20Mbps. But if none of the other four users are actually downloading at the time then 100Mbps is available for the fifth user.
[this article provides a pretty good explanation for why you are wrong.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/mathematical-theory-why-women-should-make-first-move-dating-sites-2016-3) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Basically in a scenario where men approach women but not the converse, men are as a whole guaranteed to find a better match than women (where better = higher ranked if all available partners were ranked numerically in order of preference by each member of the opposite sex - the premise of the so-called *stable marriage problem*) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The more men approach compared to women, the greater their advantage. This applies to your individual life as well. Every time you approach a woman *out of your league* you expand your chances of landing one. The chance of these women approaching *you* (you in general, not you the op) is astronomically low. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Statistically what is likely to happen if you never approach women, is that you will only ever be approached by women less appealing than the women you would've approached (and might've had a chance with).

First time I did shrooms I was lying on a couch watching T.V. waiting for them to kick in. I looked around and saw this other guy with a huge shit eating grin on his face.

I was driving my gf home when I was like 17 or so and we were stopped at a red light at an intersection waiting to proceed across onto a freeway entrance.

My gf says, *green light...go*. I kind of jokingly say, *babe, you know I need a good song on before I hit the freeway* and switch the station a couple more clicks. I hear something I like, look up to proceed and a truck with no headlights on flies through the intersection blowing through their red light. Had I taken off right when the green hit we would've gotten t-boned for sure.

I'm really intrigued by your statement. Nevermo raised in a very strict Christian household (similar to southern baptist). My exmo husband and I are trying to raise our son in a universalist style of belief so he can choose what to believe for himself. What about your upbringing was hardest or do you wish were different? This will be very good insight for us! Any opinion is greatly appreciated!  Thank you!

Mantis for 3 crates?
With the advent of the *oops we're sorry gems* from Netmarble, I was able to save enough gems to unlock the Magneto Delux Pack.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I'm still a new player and I've been saving my bio subs to upgrade my carnage's gear 15+. I was planning on using this months free tier 2 advancement ticket to get him to T2. But since I've unlocked Magneto (I was able to get 6star mastery on him via a 6 star ticket I got for being a new player). I could use my first month's advancement ticket on Magento instead, and just manually farm the chaos/blackstone to carnage's T2 advancement. I was hoping to skip out on the phoenix feather / mkran crystal grind seeing that I don't have a decent revenue stream of those mats coming in.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Any thoughts &amp; opinions as to which character I should T2 first to help me progress in the game (PVE content wise -shadowlands etc.).
Feel free to read the comments I already posted in this very thread. 
So I don't think a lot of people realize this, but there was a LOT of digital content in this crate. I don't normally sell things from my crates, but this was an exception because there were three digital items I was not going to use. I took advantage of the 31% off coupon for Halloween and I got 4 of these crates (I wanted multiples of the pop and comic). Each crate came to $16.48, for a total of $65.92. I was able to sell all 4 of the power rangers code, 2 for $15 and the other 2 for $10 (I was haggled down on eBay). I sold each of the Batman Telltale codes for $6. Finally I sold each of the VRV gift cards for $5 each. That means I made a total of $94. So that was not only enough to pay for my crates, but also make a nearly $30 profit without ever selling ANY physical items from the crate. That's kind of incredibe!  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Take advantage while you can, unless of course you're going to use any of the digital content.

You reminded of the horrors of the apps when they break and force close instantly when opened, and the only way to fix is to blow away your profile and rebuild it. Oh, only to find out, it doesn't reinstall the modern apps when Windows builds the new profile! So then you have to install them through PowerShell! Oh, but it doesnt stop there!

I haven't touched it since and never want to again. I'm surprised that people like OP can use it so much before they think to stop, I immediately knew something was deeply wrong the day after my last dose.

So I'm currently running a ppl ruitine because it feels like the best way to hit everything twice/week and be able to hit each muscle group with the specificity I want. Here's my problem/question: I tend to structure my workouts as heavy compound lifts followed by more specific work for whatever I want to prioritize for that workout. However, I feel like my bis and tris get the short end of the stick this way since they're small and always get hit last. Would it be reasonable to put bis at the beggining of my pull day and tris at the beggining of push, or will my chest/shoulders/lats/traps suffer? Should I maybe just do a couple sets of bis and tris to preexhaust but not demolish? Is hitting bis before back going to make my back workout basically pointless? Any help would be greatly appreciated. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I should add, my main goal right now is to put on size especially in my weakpoints (Shoulders, bis, tris, and a bit of upper chest, although I'd obviously like to gain mass everywhere). _back_to_line_ I'm currently 170 @ 5'11''.

I read a middle grade novel somewhat recently that used this well. Goodbye Stranger by Rebecca Stead, I think it was called.

Hmm...gallons is a unit of volume, so length^3. Acceleration is length/time^2. Ends up being (length^3 * time^2) / length = length^2 * time^2 _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Edit: because even though I’m a senior engineering major, I still don’t know my units
Go through my sockets and combination wrenches and buy new ones to replace the broken/lost ones. Probably more work than you want to do so... just buy me another watch. 
Wolf is best for MARAUDERS. Reduces enemy armor, which Marauders have a lot of, huge damage increase. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Deer is best for GUILD BOSS (especially late game) or Fox (if you already have Vesa and Ormus for healing). Deer gives armor and % health healing. Late game guild bosses will destroy teams without healing in 1-3 rounds. You get top rank in guild boss not by having the best DPS but by staying alive the longest.

&gt; it's literally impossible to ban something that exists.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ That is simply not true. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Chemical weapons have been effectively banned over the last decades. As of 2017, the [Chemical Weapons Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_Weapons_Convention) counts 195 parties and has been ratified by every major military power. According to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, 90% of global chemical agent stockpiles have verifiably been destroyed and 100% of production facilities have been inactivated. Since 1985, the Australia Group of nations has worked to restrict exports that might contribute to the production of chemical weapons. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The [Biological Weapons Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_Weapons_Convention) has also enjoyed similar results with 179 parties and participation by every major power.

But roger stressed several times he never used sockpuppets 
Maybe, but there better be some major actions that come of this if they can't even release what happened.... the facts on the ground.  There is no reason whatsoever that they couldn't have released something.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ This reminds me of the twin peaks shooting in Waco, TX that has been really nothing but a huge cover up of abuse of power and possibly was even started by a police officer and officer's with rifles wantonly assassinating people who were defending themselves. The government basically shut out the public in what was revealed more and more to be sketchier and sketchier the more you looked at the situation.

I agree with your thinking entirely. I just think that, using that same line of thought, it’s hard to see why Auburn is currently ahead of Wisconsin. So either the committee doesn’t see it the way we do, or they would have rather glaring inconsistencies from week to week. Which of course is the whole issue. This whole thing is arbitrary as fuck, like you said.

What I did was put a collision on both but then the blocks wouldn’t fall over, so I added rigid body to those. There was some weird result with the soft body ball passing through the rigid body blocks, so I added rigid to the ball so they would recognize it’s weight and fall over, but then soft body only worked if I kept the soft body goal at a high number.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Then it was 3:00 am and I had classes in the morning so I went to sleep. I couldn’t figure it out with an hour or so of playing with the collision, rigid, and soft body objects so I was wondering if anyone knew a better way to do it.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Also, it didnt seem like the rigid body blocks recognized the soft body mass and vice versa. I wanted the ball to be heavier than each of the blocks, and I didn’t know how to go about that.

I mentioned that you were 4-3 with one of the easiest schedules and, looking back, a mostly healthy team. For some reason you thought going 3-3 with even less talent surrounding the team would be the 'worst outcome' and 4-2 'being likely' and 6-0 'being possible.' _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;My point was that not having Zeke isn't the reason we are losing. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ My point was that your prediction was delusional. How do you go 4-3 against a weak schedule but then think 6-0 is even possible when you lose one of the best players on your team? Shitty coaching was a part of your team before Zeke was suspended and how you weren't able to take that into consideration with your hilariously out of touch analysis is beyond me. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Your team wasn't good before Zeke's suspension. 3-3 was never the 'worst outcome.' You'll be lucky to match that at this rate. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;you thought I was ridiculous for thinking we could win without him. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Absurd, I know.

Estás errado mais do que uma vez, o segurança se te vir a roubar pode pegar em ti e trancar-te numa sala até a policia chegar.  Se tu levas a mão ao bolso depois de ele te abordar e ele suspeitar que vais sacar de uma arma, pode-te imobilizar com arma não letal, caso não seja capaz de o fazer com a própria força. E qualquer pessoa pode ser acusada de qualquer coisa a qualquer hora, daí a ser constituído arguido, julgado e condenado vai uma longa distancia.   _back_to_line_ De resto, concordo contigo a *sociedade cigana* é um cancro, e é por isso que nutro uma certa simpatia por alguns skinheads.   _back_to_line_ Essa história de a policia não poder é a maior balela que se conta em Portugal, os policias são outro cancro, o problema da policia é que não querem trabalho, e de vez em quando lembram-se de dar uns tiros em condições desfavoráveis e normalmente pelas costas.

That is true... But I feel like we have to remember how vastly people change when they become wealthy... Statisticslly, they are significantly less likely to: _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 1. Help others (in general) _back_to_line_ 2. Share wealth with people whom need it. _back_to_line_ 3. The wealthier you are, the less you donate, and the more you *avoid* paying taxes and the like.  _back_to_line_ 4. The money will be horded and only spent on the individual. Rich people tend to be insanely cheap. _back_to_line_ 5. Have a hard time *relating* to their fellow *non rich* citizens, which results in them surrounding themselves with other wealthy folk - and their habbits/outlook rubs off on them. Everyone wants to *belong* to some kind of group. They feel like they can only relate to other wealthy people, and lose compassion/respect for their fellow citizens (who aren't rich). _back_to_line_ 6. Statisticslly much more likely to falsify documents and do illegal things to hide your money from others. Offshore + tax evasion.  _back_to_line_ 7. They seem to have a mindset of, *I have more money than you, which means I have MORE of a right to make decisions than you do*. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ But I hear you! It does enable someone to have the OPTION to do either *great good*, or * terrible evil*. Its just unfortunate that the latter seems to be more common, the wealthier you get.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Money turns good people in sleez bags. Of course this isn't 100%, but it sure seems to be the norm!
If law enforcement won't handle it, talk to your phone company.  They will take it seriously. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ And the person doing the calling.  They might not be targeting you.

If you don't have surveillance cameras up, I would get some up, and then loudly advertise that you have surveillance cameras up.  Signs on the door, and stuff like that.  Or entering the driveway.

I used to be this person! _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The thing is, at a certain point in your life, being friends with girls *is* more complicated and involved than being friends with boys. That same point (around 16-22, in my experience) is also when everyone is solidifying as a person, and girls, at least, tend to be more unaccepting of social aberrations. Guys just wanted to hang out, play video games, smoke weed, and talk about asses and philosophy. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ At around the point when you stop referring to people as 'girls and boys' and start referring to them as 'women and men', that was when I started to accumulate more female friends. This has probably less to do with the people themselves, and more to do with me being more comfortable expressing myself and what I want in a friendship. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Also yes, goddamnit, I love drama - but not when I'm involved in it. I like being drama-adjacent, so I can put on my little opera glasses, fan myself with a brace of ostrich feathers and watch the sudden Shakespeare.
**Rewatcher - First time broadcast viewer** _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Man, I missed these characters. Kyon and Haruhi especially. Sugita's sass and sarcasm coupled with Aya's crass and energy breathes life into me. I am participating in the Clannad rewatch as well as studying up for final exams so my write-ups will probably be less analytical than I would like. Nevertheless, I'm excited to rewatch the anime that solidified my love of Slice of Life and KyoAni. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ * Guys, we should have known [spoiler](/s *Endless Eight was coming. Mikuru runs by that storefront at the start of this film 5 times. And there's different animation and voice acting with each cut.*) Those sly bastards. This is some *heavy* foreshadowing that KyoAni put in 3 years in advance. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ * This film is so bad. It's just a cut above /r/DeepIntoYouTube material. Only saved by Kyon's stellar narration. That said, I do appreciate how well KyoAni did at making this look bad. The 4:3 aspect ratio, the terrible voice acting from the side cast, random bystanders starting up their cars in the background. All of it come together to make this one terrible film. And that's not even considering the plot and the *plot*. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ * I really dug how KyoAni even added Kyon and Haruhi in the true episode end credits as if this was a real production.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ This was a heavy dose of *what the fuck did I just watch* if I didn't already know the story. I know some viewers really like starting with this episode, but I still prefer it's place in the chronological order. If I had initially started the series on this episode I would not have felt any incentive to continue at all. I'll try to refrain from any further comparisons between watch orders until the end of the rewatch though. If I don't I'm liable to only talk about that in my comments.
I never once said I agree with circumcision, shit Ive even said I wouldnt have it done on my own child.

While driving I will have these realistic 'daydreams' while on the highway. In these daydreams I see myself making a mistake and then accidentally crashing my car in a catastrophic accident.

I don't know why the hell this is happening, but it really freaks me out, and I feel bad for having these thoughts.

That’s an issue there, I can agree with that.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It feels bad to get a LMR for a character you don’t have a SB for, let alone not have at all or don’t have a Memory crystal to break level caps for. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ But it’s in the game anyway. So it must not be such a big issue. And what if you do get a SB for that character? Now you have a LMR to go with it. That’s why I say it’s an issue but maybe not really THAT big an issue to where it’s just out-and-out a bad idea.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ A calculated risk is fine in my book.

It is but most employers seeking out college students aren't going to want to screen 100 applicants with shit grades. Coming from a school that did not include an internship opportunity only encouraged them.

I'm all for weed, please don't think I'm trying to get you to quit... but I was having eerily similar things happening to me and they've toned down a bit after I significantly cut down my weed intake. (I went from smoking every single day, sometimes multiple times a day, to only smoking once or twice a month and using edibles a few times a week.) I would also constantly hear different versions of myself, with different personalities, conversing in my head/narrating what I was doing, ridiculing me for little things, etc.  My issues are still there. I don't think they'll ever go away. But being high definitely makes it worse for me. I know it helps you sleep (did the same for me), but maybe consider cutting down? I don't know what advice to give you about sleep though, because I'm having that problem too. No matter what you decide to do, I wish you luck, because this kind of thing really sucks.
You can appeal I have done it before and they are pretty forgiving, its worth giving it a try before you pay. _back_to_line_

It uses mode 7 near the end, in the level *Neon Night Riders*. The one where you're riding those floating disc things. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The thing to remember is that mode 7 **only** worked on the background layer. If there's anything behind it, it's not mode 7. Notice that whenever they used mode 7 for something like a boss (e.g. the golem from Castlevania IV), the background was always a solid color. That's because the boss itself *was* the background.
For me weed is easy to quit for 1-4 months but really easy after a certain point to convince yourself that you gained control over it and quitting was so easy anyway why not just smoke once. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ And here I am.

Snow's. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ That being said as a BBQ afficianado who has traveled the US eating regional que, the pig is a holier animal. Sure the brisket as a singular cut may be more sophisticated, but the pig as a whole is superior. You get jowls, head meat, ribs, back, belly and hams all with unique wonderful properties. Also pig skin cracklins put stupid leather to shame. Until someone can smoke a whole cow like you can a pig consistently, the hog rules.

Nice! A correction, though (people do this all the time): You can't just change a stat by applying a multiplier to a base stat. The calculation doesn't work that way. For example, in Darmanitan's case, a 105 base HP at lv100 with perfect IV and no EV would be 351, while a 52.5 would be ~246. If you wanted to halve the HP, you would need a base HP of 17. If you're using a max EV Darmanitan, 105 base HP would be 414. If you want to halve that (207), you literally can't (no joke). A base HP of 2 would give you 208 HP. Base HP of 1 is hardcoded at 1. You would literally need like a base HP of 1.5 to achieve that, which is way different from 52.5.
This topic is sure to turn into quite the treat.

Nope, there is no way for a Jew to become a non-Jew. From the perspective of Judaism, a Jew is anyone whose mother was a Jew or who underwent a valid conversion. A Jew who doesn’t practice Judaism is still a Jew, and a Jew who practices some other religion is an apostate but still a Jew. There’s no way of getting out of being a Jew once you are one. However, a Jew who goes “off the *derech*” (becomes non-practicing or an apostate) can always repent and come back and be completely forgiven and accepted. There’s also a concept of being “tinok shenishba,” a Jew who has no idea what his responsibilities are because he wasn’t raised or taught properly (the term literally means a “captured infant,” like a Jew who was kidnapped at birth and raised as a gentile, but it also applies to Jews who were just raised secular and so on); people like that aren’t held totally responsible for the things they do wrong, because they’re sinning out of unavoidable ignorance.

I live in Denver now. Where are the cannabis zone clubs going to be? For science. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Ridiculous the sheer amount of bureaucratic horsecockery that's gone on since legalization, just so people can safely &amp; socially blaze. Meanwhile, take a quick walk down 16th Street and tell me how many hobos are shamelessly smoking from bongs right in the open. My co-worker and I have taken a couple under-over bets on seeing hobos w/ bongs during our lunch walk.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Was talking to a budtender about this about a year ago. She goes in the back and pulls out an enormous (250 page) binder with ALL of the weed laws/stipulations and such passed since regulation. Every dispensary owner has to know that damned thing front and back, but that's so hard as the law is constantly changing.

I think I reported it with *Excessive partisanship,* but that was when I saw it 10 days ago, can't remember for sure.
That’s true - it was an unfortunate system. I really disliked picking either character to start off with and then having the potential to transform partway through the match. Splitting the characters works out much better.

Great advice.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Beware, though: paying attention to calories is like measuring your car's speed and performance ONLY looking at the smoke it generates. It's ridiculous. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ This suggestion is low calorie, sure, but that's just a side effect. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The important part is that you're eating healthy, high-fiber foods. This greatly absorbs the glycemic impact of your meal, increases dramatically the health of your digestive system, and, as rempel pointed out, helps your gut flora too.

So while trying to access things I would check the pihole logs and see what's being blocked (in red) then whitelist that entry or entries.

Ive been wanting to make a post about it ever since I got it. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Splatoon 2 is amazing! Agree with you on all points.

Maybe issues with the agricultural growth cycle, some vegetables are grown after the soil is fallowed, I’m thinking like more issues with topsoil depletion, leading to more chemicals- fertilizers &amp; pesticides ending up in the groundwater. Also: I could see issues with running out of places to grow naturally, because of seasons. There would have to be tons more hothouses and only easily grown crops that are hearty would become staples.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Less diversity in the gene pool, which can lead to problems like being vulnerable to a certain pest or disease _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Supply would be severely affected by the the ability of that vegetable to be stored and shipped long term. I could see a lot more GMO crops aimed at storage and ability to stay fresh longer or whatever.

I'm not trying to overstate the intelligence of ants but I think it's a little premature in our understanding of animal intelligence and behavior to assume ants are just robots. For example so species of bull ants pass the mirror test which is actually pretty profound and given that ants are social insects/animals they're definitely on the more intelligent side of insects so it's worth thinking about.
I quite enjoyed reading that. I think you should tell more stories.
Well, mortal level doesn't really seem to have anything to do with strength (maybe to an extent). It looks like it's more something regarding universe organization, the God's doing their duties well, peacefulness, etc. Our universe is the strongest in the tournament basically (Jiren's a big outlier) and we had the second worst mortal level. Supreme Kai and Beerus are incompetent, lol.
I bought the TS75 and have yet to use it on anything where I need the extra depth.  Although I did upgrade because I have some 8/4+ slabs sitting in my shop that I will eventually get around to and I needed the extra length then.  I did some tests with a TS55 and you could cut 8/4+ as deep as possible, finish with a hand saw, and then use a flush trim bit to clean it up if you absolutely had to.  The Makita has an even deeper depth of cut than the TS55 as well so it might not even a problem.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Long story short, the depth of cut is probably sufficient for most people.

and the Vex are able to teleport across time and space in an instant. They could have some sort of jump capability the allows them to close the distance. Even if they're not the spot light enemy of the DLC, at least introduce them in it or set them up. Those new ships were the most exciting things for me because they were brand new things that have unlimited potential. We know what the Hive can do for the most part, we know what the fallen can do, and so on and so forth. Bungie can set these guys up to give us new powers if they wanted, new weapons, it's the thing I'm most excited for and I just want a taste of what they can do and what they are.
I highly recommend a resource called *Radical Self Acceptance; A Buddhist Guide to Freeing Yourself From Shame.* Although it's built on a Buddhist contemplative foundation, it doesn't depend on any wu-wu spirituality and is totally useful to even a hardcore atheist. I can personally testify to how transformative it was for me at a very difficult time in my life.

I've never truly understood this because most people have dealt with at least a breakup, if not a SI cheating or divorce. I'll try my best to explain it though. Everyone has tripped and fell, but it's still funny to watch for a 2 main reasons: 1. It's painful, but not to you, and 2. You can likely relate, but you likely got over your own problem already. Relationship trouble is just a very amplified version of tripping. You might have been hurt by a similar situation, but the humor of it happening to someone else is comedic (I guess).

I think I know why people aren't getting drops even after wild hours. To get a drop your name needs to be in the viewer list? As I was idling I checked it from time to time to see if my name was in the streamers list. I eventually noticed my name was not appearing in the viewer list. I tried going to another streamers channel, restarting chrome, and relogging with twitch. My name still did not appear. I'm not sure if this is what is causing this but it is my guess.  If this is the case people can be viewing a stream for a long period but they won't be aware if they are even getting rolls because of issues like this. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Then there is also the factor where you don't know if the streamer you're viewing has disabled drops or not

Shown here is an (ultra-simplified) representation of the planet Cedkh, along with two of its moons, Verukt and Ortod, shown with Earth for scale. Cedkh is the second planet from in the **Sors-Arwe system**, a large binary star system orbiting around a red giant called **Sors** and a yellow giant called **Arwe**. Cedkh is located 45.6 light years from Earth. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 50 million years ago, Cedkh was an ocean planet dominated by a single, planet-wide body of water, and millions of islands, reefs and archipelagos. After conquest by the Fleshbenders and the complete eradication of its original human inhabitants, the planet was modified into its current state by its new alien overlords. The oceans were siphoned into orbit, to form a Saturn-like ring of ice around the planet (not shown in this image), or to be used in other geoforming projects throughout the Sors-Arwe binary system. As the seafloor was desiccated and converted desert, the grand coral forests started to die out and calcify, becoming eerie fossilized ghosts of their former selves. The deserts of the Old and New World are divided into thirteen *Kols* (“Great Deserts”), with many smaller desert biomes, known as *Sugs* (“Lesser Deserts”). For instance, the volcanic desert of ash fields and lava rivers known as Sug Isimenke is located within Kol Seylung, and the iron-sand desert of Sug Aoshtuhi is located within Kol Ensaw. And within these deserts are oasis biomes, and rivers flowing down from ice caps atop the mountains and plateaus, the latter of which is home to the forgotten cities of the planet’s original human population, now reclaimed by vines and the elements. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The planet’s masses of dry land became mountain ranges and uplifted plateaus as the waters receded. The largest of these uplifted areas is the **Spine of the World**, with its two tallest peaks, **Emhundke Ush** and **Koruntke Ush**, reaching 13.4 miles and 12.4 miles tall, respectively. Together, these two mountains form the **“Gate of the Worlds”**. The Spine cuts across Cedkh’s uninhabitable equatorial sub-desert, **Sug Kilnr** – a region so hot and dry that only silicon-based and nanotech-based lifeforms can call it home. The Spine is thus the only practical way of crossing from the “Old World” to the “New World” and vice-versa. The **Long Road** carved into the rock and ice of the Spine is flanked by idols carved into the peaks, so that pilgrims of all faiths might be able to worship during the harsh journey through the snowy passage. The presence of Sug Kilnr has resulted in the Old and New Worlds having divergent plant and animal populations. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ As you move away from the equator and towards the poles, things start to get a little wetter. The desert starts to turn into savanna, grassland, shrubland and scattered wetlands. This region is known as **Kaubsang**. As you head further towards the poles, the tree growth grows thicker and the rain becomes more and more common. Eventually, it turns into thick rain forest, mangrove swamps and tropical grasslands. These tropical regions are known as the **Far North** and **Far South**. At the top and bottom of Cedkh are two large oceans, which recall the warm, tropical seas of Earth’s West Indies and Southeast Asia. Here, one can find remnants of Cedkh’s bygone coral reefs, lush and filled with relict lifeforms leftover from the planet’s archaic global ocean. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ There eight intelligent races on Cedkh – Noapte, Eoteng, Vhung, Nsenke, Ulunau, Tohung, Deshkol and Sroatr. All of them are “humanids” – belonging to the evolutionary tree of the “Greater Human Family”. All save for the Sroatr and Deshkol are descended from posthuman lifeforms engineered by the Fleshbenders, using human DNA. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The **Noapte** hail from the Old World. The most numerous race on Cedkh, Noaptes are nocturnal carnivores with a highly martial, spiritual and honor-oriented culture, and are perfectly adapted to life in their desert homeland – children of the sand nurtured on the desert’s bitterness. They have spread to the deserts of the New World as well as the Southern Kaubsang, though colonization of the Far North and Far South has proven especially difficult for them due to rampant disease, to which they have no immunity. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The **Eoteng** (who refer to themselves as **Sh’anhui**) are an offshoot of the Noapte, who fled the harsh heat of the desert for the cool and wet darkness of the underground. Millions of years later, the Eoteng are blind albinos with vestigial eyes (in contrast to their Noapte cousins, with their jet black skin and excellent night vision) and a complex, sophisticated culture which exists almost entirely in darkness. Due to the limitations of the their subterranean civilizations, the Eoteng have for the most part remained in the Old World, though they have very recently begun to colonize the New World. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ In the Northern Kaubseng originated the **Ulunau**. Alabaster-skinned insectivores with armored faces, the history of the Ulunau has been in part defined by their status as middlemen for trade between the Noapte of the south and the peoples of the Far North, though today Ulunau traders, craftsmen and mercenaries can be found all over Cedkh. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The **Nsenke** (who refer to themselves as **Pahun**) are the bizarre, beaked humanids, possessing 24 limbs derived from modified fingers and toes. Having previously evolved from tree-dwelling social animals, the Nsenke have become Confucian bureaucrats obsessed with ethnic homogeneity, and as such, their societies are highly segregated by ethnicity and tribal identity, with non-Nsenke immigrants often serving as intermediaries. Nevertheless, the Nsenke are known for being organized, business-oriented and skilled as craftsmen and tinkerers, and were responsible for re-introducing clocks and firearm mechanisms to Cedkh. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Sharing the Far North with their Nsenke relatives, are the **Vhung**. Though the two races both have beaks derived from what once were human teeth, and both have six digits on each hand, this is where the similarities end. The Vhung have a more conventional humanoid body plan, but grow to incredible sizes – with adult males often reaching 60 feet in height, and for all their size, the Vhung are not only strong, but surprisingly swift and agile. However, despite their fearsome appearance, the Vhung are most famous for their pacifism, humility, piety, patience and easy-going, aesthetic lifestyles. They weren’t always this way. In fact, the ancient **Ban Empire** of the Vhung once dominated the entire Far North and Northern Kaubsang, until a philosophical paradigm shift occurred which led to this race of giants forsaking their militaristic ways in pursuit of instead “living in tune with the rhythm things have”. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ **“Sroatr”** is a broad term used to describe the population of *Homo sapiens* present on Cedkh. Terrans have only been on Cedkh for the last 8,000 years or so. These are *not* the First Incarnation humans (or, as they are known on Cedkh, **Sroanun**) that the other races of Cedkh descend from. Instead these are Second Incarnation humans, brought to Cedkh from Earth by the cruel star-god, **Coyote**. Though the majority of the Sroatr appeared in the deserts of the Old World, others appeared in the Far North, Northern Kaubsang, and a few even along the shores of the Southern Sea, for reasons unknown. “Sroatr” can refer specifically to those Terrans who were culturally assimilated by the Noapte, forsaking their Earth customs, languages and religions for those of the Noapte. Terrans who materialized in the Far North have not *quite* been integrated into Nsenke society, but they have adopted much of Nsenke philosophy and cultural practices, and occupy distinct niches in Nsenke society – these Terrans are referred to as **Leng**. Most of the Terrans along the Southern Sea have died out, but a few maintain a limited relationship of cooperation with the Tohung. Other Terrans have not integrated at all, and maintain cultural and social independence from the indigenous races of Cedkh, often to very xenophobic and standoffish degrees – these Terrans are known as **Tanun**, and they tend to be a mishmash of ancient Earth cultures. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ And lastly, there are the **Deshkols**. Deshkols are a hybrid race of Sroatrs and Noaptes. Depending on which race the father was, a Deshkol might look more like a Noapte than a Sroatr, or more like a Sroatr than a Noapte, or be an equal mix of both species. Unlike most interspecific hybrids, Deshkols are fertile, and, indeed, there are some regions where Deshkols are the majority population. The mere existence of Deshkols has been a force for keeping Noaptes and Sroatrs culturally united, though there do exist attitudes against race-mixing. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ There are some smaller and less relevant races, such as the floating, octahedron race of alien sorcerers known as the **Ilang**, or the reptilian savages known as the **Oruk** (both hailing from the volcanic desert of Sug Isimenke), or the bygone, unnamed elephantine humanid race known to have once inhabited the Far South prior to going extinct, however, these eight races are the dominant peoples on Cedkh.

A Bluetooth adapter with the QC20's isn't going to last the 10 hours that the QC30's do. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Really, with the amount of phones coming out that don't have headphone ports, it's hard to recommend wired headphones especially when the wireless versions are only lacking in battery life by 6 hours (10 hours is still long).

&gt; That sounds like a good policy to me; let districts make their own decisions. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I don't follow you.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I can see the logic in having different laws for different places.

I think the suspense alone would've been better than the player I got.. 
No, I've stated that the decline has already been bucked, because that's what the facts show.

First of all great intro of the stack. I have a question though, about holding priority, which is mentioned in the article.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Is there a limit of how many times you can hold priority? Can I cast -&gt; hold priority indefinitely, as long I have spells/abilities to cast or just after the first spell/ability is put on the stack?
Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one that appreciates a good meat to bread ratio. Give me a few more slices of bread and I would have a whole other sandwich with what's in the pic. It does look good though.

 fascinating!   (and not creepy... at least to me) _back_to_line_ I just read about Crownsville.  :(   Man, awful grim stuff. Those facilities were often so terrible.  I can only imagine how bad the segregated ones may have been.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ A hobby of mine when I hear or read about someone's supposed family background (especially old movie stars) is check them out.   I love realizing how different their history was from the PR they or the studios put out. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Thanks for sharing!
Yup!
Support. There's this one guy that would constantly crash me no matter what I was doing. Adding him to ignore didn't do much since he still knew my world and would find me. Of course I could've turned my private OFF to prevent this but that's just silly. Making it so where no one can message me just to protect myself from one troll didn't seem worth it.

Had everything on my hard drive so backing everything up to my old-turned-new channel was easy, all I've really lost are my subscribers but frankly I can't be arsed 
I really like the Psychic Spam combo with Lele and Gross, since I like playing a more offensive style. Set up is pretty cool too, especially Sam Pandelis' team for Worlds, so I'm trying to build a team oriented around offense/bulky offense. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I apologize for this being a noob at this, but what is Chalk? I also like running faster teams so I should I put 1 or 2 mons that are slow for TR or just run an entire team of fast offensive mons? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 
Not that durable from experience. I’m on my second from catching a clearing dump on the wrist. I’ve since stopped reversing it to the inside of my wrist and it’s not been an issue. 
I think it’s cool and with some tweaks to the UI (not aimed at you, just aimed at financial reporting in genera) and some shiny, this could be quite the tool.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Have you given any thought to tapping the Robinhood market (the folks that flock to it because it’s free, typically young, savy, folks who are new to investing and trying to get their feet wet)? Maybe a version in between free trial and full features?  Enough to help them pick their first few stocks and help them realize the value? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I see exactly the use case for a power user, but it would be great if there was something in between.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Part of this is also me looking for something that’s going to help educate folks on the markets and make the numbers and such way less scary.   I have SO many friends who think stocks and such are only for finance people and they are dutifully saving some money each paycheck but have no idea how to actually invest for retirement,  future theoretical kid’s college funds, etc.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_

If you enjoy pew pew yes, but the pay hardy out weighs the risk, and quite honestly if i was looking for pew pew i would just PvP instead. They story with the goids really hasn't gone anywhere, and nothing of super major importance has gone on in game. I get all my info from here then disappear for the day. I'm not gonna say it isn't fun for some, but I'm burnt man. Last thing i was doing was mining for armor engineer and just... Stopped. This rant went a bit further than i meant it to.
I am 100% going to make a new build with this chip, however I am not willing to pay this kind of markup.  Hopefully there will be some price deals in the next 4 months.

Is there any good data package deal for telkomsel? I swear that they fucking pissed me off since they get rid of the 125k package and have shitty 70k packages instead.
Does it just count the stats of the rune or also the type of the rune as well.  I mean a good energy rune will probably be sold which a good violent will always be kept. 
But that’s money.

Recommit means to send the bill back to committee.  If that vote were to pass, it would end the current debate, and the bill would be sent back to the Senate Finance Committee.
Microaggressions aren't as big a deal as you would have us believe. There are no Roma or Gypsies where I live in the US, it's a very localized thing to a few areas of Eastern Europe. Everywhere else it's just a word, it has lost almost all the negative connections it once had...all you are doing is revitalizing and strengthening a connection to racism that had already nearly vanished from the public perception.
Check out the lamp-type thing hanging from the tunnel ceiling under the clock tower. It looks exactly like the transfer device we have to power up with zombies to get the first tesla pieces, and it almost looks like it has a slot for a bttery. Not only that, there is another one in the jack in the box house, and 2 more by lightning rod tower, which matches the number of batteries to build the tesla variants
My armchair theory is that MtFs are overrepresented because the government's putting chemicals in the water in order to feminize society and make them more receptive to the (((globalist))) cuck agenda. FtMs are just steroid enhanced feminazi supersoldiers who work directly for George Soros, but he can't manufacture too many of them otherwise it would become obvious to his BLM Antifa strike force that they're being replaced and they might revolt. But that won't be a problem after the old Soros paramilitary and the US National Guard are reduced to feminine fuccbois by the xenoestrogens that are being manufactured in the basement of Comet Ping Pong pizza restaurant (the child sex ring is only a front). _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Mark my words, 2018 will be the year that FtM death squads freely roam the streets and overthrow both the puppet US Government and the real Deep State Shadow Government that's actually in control. They'll gun down OUR congress and REPLACE THEM with the gay socialist militias who staged the Sandy Hook false flag shooting, AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE IT!

The only issue with that imo is that it doesn't clean as well as electric. It's like hand polishing a car vs using a rotary.
That sort of is the point.

My concern isn't the std. Just that I  never reported it. Im worried when I tell my recruiter I'll get discharged or something like that.
Sure it's awesome for you. And the player base is shit because of squads vs solos. Not the other way around.  I love playing in groups, and I love solos. But they don't mix, and it's not healthy for the game. Or any game really.
I really loved the 'Death Match' bar!!! The one that was all about horror movies. I also definitely stayed at *Karaoke* until about 5AM also... lol
I think I know about the time he grabbed the girls ass and it was only because she was already all over him. He has much better social cues than ice so I don't think he would have done it if the girl was uncomfortable (which she wasn't even afterwards).

Congrats! what scholly did they offer?
How? Dude still has at least another 4 years of eligibility to get through.
The group was fine. They were obviously a premade 3 man group that could last an hour. Some people just want to stay long for the hell of it and even if they were trolling when you start throwing insults Im just not waste my time trying to make sense out of you.
Well done. Wish I could find an olive one like that. Were the feednecks threaded from these? They're probably the best budget builds currently.
A friend showed me some of their older stuff and I liked it a lot. After Laughter's one of my favorite albums of this year, but I didn't like their self-titled album that much, tbh.
I’ve heard you can take 340 with 290 if you get sign off for it. Which would ease the load for spring quarter, which looks like it’s going to be very intense.
I've been praising this game in other threads so I'll just give the short version: This is the first game that has recaptured the magical feeling that Dark Souls gave me since Dark Souls was released (sequels included) while remaining iterative rather than derivative. The sound design really stands out. [Here's an example that actually had me laughing out loud while playing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJzK50Cb24s)

They will put you all the way thru to ACS before doing anthropomorphic measurements.  If you pass ACS for pilot and other trades and can't fit in a cockpit I can almost guarantee you they will encourage you to go ACSO.

FUCK YOU AUSTRIA!!! _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ [](#frustration) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ So I'm playing EU4 and I started a Poland game. Sadly I couldn't get the PU over Bohemia but everything was going pretty well outside of that. Then I notice that the Ottomans had gotten into a rather nasty war with the Mamelukes. Considering that I was allied to a large Brandenburg and Austria, who had a PU over Hungary, whilst also having a PU over Lithuania myself this seemed like the perfect time to strike. I quickly knocked the Crimea out of the war and then get to work on the Ottoman's other ally, Bohemia. They are soon dealt with and our vast forces turn on the Ottomans. However we keep losing battles because my allies keep separating their forces. Despite this we press on and take some key forts while the Mamelukes make advances in the East. The war is basically won and it is a matter of mopping up. That is until fucking Austria decides to peace out. Now the Ottomans out number us 2:1 (Brandenburg and I had taken the brunt of the losses) and a tone of the occupied land flipped back to the Ottomns. So here I am with 17k troops to my name, no manpower, no occupied land, and at -44% warscore. The only real way to win this war would be to take a bunch of loans and build a tone of mercs, which would hurt my professionalism and set be back decades, making me very vulnerable to Russian invasion. So fuck you Austria, I was ready to give you a bunch of land but you had to get greedy and run away with the land I gave you in the peace deal with Bohemia. Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you. You fucking ruined my run. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ [](#yuitears)

We *all* can't have him (I do tho).
&gt;The bow remained hidden deep underground for centuries, unknown, untouched, and all but forgotten until Noxian invaders attacked Ionia. **Two beast hunters - Valmar and his heartlight, Kai - fought the first wave of these invaders at the Temple of Pallas. Though their courage was great and drove off the attackers, Kai was mortally wounded. A grief-stricken Val carried him inside, praying the temple’s magic would restore him.** _back_to_line_ But the temple held only damnation, and both hunters were consumed by the unleashed power of the darkin. The very matter of their bodies was unraveled and bound together in a warp and weft of new flesh to craft a perfect body, fit to bear the soul of Varus. What emerged from the temple was a gestalt creature, pale and inhumanly beautiful, part human, part darkin, Varus was reborn as an entity with a war for supremacy being waged in its soul. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/champion/varus/

Shouldn't twitter open up a YT window. Does YouTube not count those toward views?
Interesting build. I do have a 5 star Athena with bad IVs, and am in desperate need of a red flier, with H!Nowi failing to come home. Since Palla's stats are pretty balanced, she won't need to worry about green tomes as well, which is a weakness my current team can't deal with right now. 
Finally found a mango pack that I knew I had saved. Differences _back_to_line_ 100% authentic ones have “alternative for adult smokers” on top of front, don’t for everything is bold on the ones I just got, there’s a QR on back of 100% authentic, bar code has same numbers, and finally the most important in my eyes is that in the info on back the 100% authentic pack has 2017 copyright and the ones I just got have 2016, so I’m assuming they are just an old pack.
Aw I'm sorry to hear that. The panic when you feel someone pulling away makes alot of sense - the day when my friend freaked out about me asking her kid to put on her seatbelt and started screaming at me in the car while I was driving, I dropped her off, told her to get out or I was calling the cops - and she acted by grabbing my driver's license and credit cards and taking off. Later, she said it was because she was scared I was just going to up and leave without giving her a chance to mend things.
Well... that's not good

They sent someone from NYC to Alabama to disrupt a local elections campaign rally.  This is only going to further galvanize his base and push fence sitters his way because they don’t want to be associated with people like that.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ They really screwed the pooch on this one.  I’ve said this before, they should have just floated the allegations out there and let the chips fall, but no of course they trot or a fake yearbook which even if it was real doesn’t really prove anything, bring in Gloria fucking Allred which is a giant bat signal of fake accusations. They’re stupid, constantly overplay their hand, and don’t take one minute to try and beat their opponent on policy.  Nobody on the left learned a thing from the presidential election, they just think if they  virtue signal *harder* it’ll be sure to work.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Anyway my point is, I don’t care if it’s illegal let them keep doing it. 
You're assuming 65% of people voted for them wanted electoral reform.
then he beat the Bears and made me sad. Maybe the stats weren't there but to come back like that was still impressive

Nobody is arguing that LFR should be in classic. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ But i understand why its a thing in Legion. And no before you get your *Legion sucks*-pussy wet, its not because Legion is easier and Blizzard is money hungry to please noobs. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Its because people who pay for the game should be able to atleast see the content in it. I see LFR more as a cinematic about the lore than as a raid. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ And anyone who has raided mythic in Legion does not care about LFR and knows that anyone saying *Newer expansions are easy. Just look at LFR* are fucking idiots. Its like saying Vanilla raiding is easy because Deadmines is fucking easy as fuck. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The only bad thing about LFR is that it has a chance to drop legendarys so even hard core players feel obligated to do it. I couldnt care less if LFR is in the game, as long as i dont have to do it.
is that a pro or a con?

I definitely want them to kiss. There's such thing as couples that have no reason together, but these two would make sense. I hope they get some time isolated from the group where they can really get to talking and exploring their feelings.
Why no TNT crew this week?
I play on xbox and the aim pull is indeed a real thing. Moments when it feels like youre trying to touch two repelling magnets together. I enjoy the game but this is a very real thing. Wasnt sure if i was the only one who noticed on occasion. And as someone whos played many pc shooters over almost two decades, its abundantly clear that 99% of the people mashing that downvote button are children who dont understand how precise a mouse actually is.

If you mean https://github.com/ryankiros/skip-thoughts#getting-started I also tried that and fared little better as the documentation amounts to 'here's a few random lines of Python you can punch into a REPL and eh you can figure out the rest'. Well, actually, no, I can't, being neither a Python programmer nor an expert on your skip-thought datastructures and text formatting...

Yeah I agree. However in one of the posters there appears to be a crashed X-wing near Lukes island on Ach-to, so all hope is not lost 😄

The scanner at the hospital I used to work for is capable of scanning bariatric patients; the gantry (the donut) has a larger bore and there’s a special table than can accommodate up to 660 lbs. Every once in a while a patient that was STILL too big was shipped either the zoo or the veterinary school. One night, we had a woman that weighed over 800 lbs. The ER had to push two stretchers together just to give her a place to lie down.
Haggis. It gets a bad rep but it’s actually delicious, and they make vegetarian versions too. You don’t just have to have it for special events either, like St Andrews Day and Burns Night, it’s nice just on a roll.

No it wouldn't. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It wouldn't be costly because the cost of a single accident is much greater than the cost of administering a driving test. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It wouldn't be hard to implement or enforce, because it would just be integrated into the already-existing concept of license expiration. You already have to renew your license every few years (which doesn't really make sense, because you automatically get a new one, so why does it need to expire?). The only thing that would need to change is that when your license expires, instead of automatically getting it renewed just for showing up, you have to take a driving test again. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ True, there's no guarantee that someone won't just drive with an expired license, but that's true now anyway.

1st, He has A rank strength only, not A+ _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 2nd, Gilgamesh doesn't just have Enkidu or Ea or GoB. He has plenty of other things in GoB that he can draw out for different circumstances. Arthur doesn't even have anyway to counter just GoB shooting from all directions like he did against Alcides, let alone what he actually can draws out of the Gate like his ability to levitate, his Auto-Defensor in FSF, Vimana, so on  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;Protos Excalibur counters ea if 7 of the conditions are met it becomes an anti world noble phantasm so there’s goes Gilgamesh strongest weapon  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 1st Arthur cannot control how many restraints can be released. It's completely dependent on each individual circumstances. Even against the Beast in Prototype only 6 of the Restraints can be released. 2ndly Ea is not a planetary threat -&gt; Excalibur Proto cannot fully realize its full power (just like normal Excalibur). Against the most comparable being which is Ozymandias, it gets overpowered by Ozy's Dendera Light Bulb. Enuma Elish would destroy Excalibur Proto in a direct clash with Arthur's restriction. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Edit: Glancing through most of your comments here most seems like complete headcanon and overreliance on stats to judge servants. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 
Did they raise the bmi for an anorexia nervosa diagnosis? If I'm recalling right it used to be 17 or so. I know they dropped EDNOS and made it into OSFED fairly recently (as far as books go) 
Wouldn't a nominal solution have been to just reduce the frequency of public events in the first place? 
No, he did. Remember, when the young X team is sneaking into the snowy base they come across Wolverine in weapon x, and even use him as a distraction before Jean releases him into the wild. Something like that. I only saw it once and remember being annoyed they crammed Wolverine in again.

I'm not saying I'm sold on it being him. All I did was copy and paste articles off murderpedia. If it was him, well deserved. But I'd never condone hassling a possible victim.

The demon stood in the corridor, flames licking its body. Its glowing red eyes bore a malice of ages, a contempt that had festered in the bowels of the underworld for aeons. Smoke billowed from its nose, curling up to the ceiling in acrid yellow clouds. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *Who dares to stand in the way of D'thora, destroyer of worlds?* his deep, gravelly bass voice boomed. *Which fool chooses to challenge my will?* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I sucked on the end of my toothpick, deliberately making the asshole wait for my reply.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It's all about power dynamics, dude. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *Name's Bob,* I finally replied.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The demon's face went from one of undisguised contempt to one of irritation and confusion.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *Bob?* he asked. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *Bob,* I replied. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The demon paused, the look of confusion becoming more intense.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *Bob what? Bob the reaper? Bob the light guardian? Bob, the eternal defender of the people?* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I paused once again, before replying.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *Nope. Just Bob.* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The demon's gaze fell from my face, and he stared at the floor, evidently lost in thought.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *Odd,* he muttered in his gravelly voice. *I don't recall any heroes named Bob. I'm sure my lord would have mentioned it before I started this whole thing.* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *Well,* I said slowly, as if addressing a child, *That might be because I ain't no hero.* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ His eyes shot back up to mine. *What do you mean, you aren't a hero?* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *Ain't a hero, plain as that. I'm the custodian.* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ A wave of understanding washed over the demon's face. *Ahh, I see. You're the guardian of this facility then. It remains under your protection and custody.* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *Nuh uh,* I said, shaking my head slowly. *I'm just the custodian.* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The confusion returned. *I don't understand.* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *I... am... the custodian,* I said slowly. Caretaker. Janitor. Whatever you wanna call it. I clean the place.* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *You... you clean it?* it growled. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *Yup,* I replied. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *You are not a hero?* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *Nope.* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *Then... nothing stands between me and the artifact! Move aside, mortal!* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *Nope,* I said, chewing on the toothpick. *You ain't goin' in there. I just waxed the floor.* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *I go where I please!* exploded the demon, charging forward. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I whipped the portal gun from my pocket, firing it at the floor in front of the demon. He tried to stop, but his hooves slipped on the freshly waxed floor, and he slid inside it the hole and into an eternal void. The portal sealed itself with a soft 'pop'.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I smiled to myself. There were some benefits to working at Area 51. But within moments, the smile faded as I realized what had just happened. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *Shit. Now I gotta rewax that part of the floor.*

Seriously I don't think I have any party that I take without LV except in the uncommon cases where AoE or Light damage are a problem. Too damn saucy. Even my enhanced TT hasn't seen battle. Bloody Moon clear was courtesy of a OTKO featuring 3 LVs and an Emperor.
Maybe try gifting her with “all natural” hygiene products.  The all natural deodorants aren’t as good as the other stuff but maybe she would like her products enough to shower more than once a week.  _back_to_line_ I did something similar when my cousin who lived with me didn’t shower or wash her clothes bc she was lazy. I bought her a fruity smelling bath set that she loved so much I swear she bathed twice a day.

Okay, here's what I've used up: _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ * Dr. Jart Premium Firming Sleeping Mask, Travel Size: I love this mask, but it appears to have been discontinued. Wah! _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ * Elizavecca Milky Piggy Carbonated Bubble Clay Mask: I've gone through several of these. It's my favorite clay mask, and in spite of the foaming qualities, it's gentler on my skin than a traditional clay mask. I will have to hold off on RP, however, as my friend gave me a big jar of a Borghese clay mask for my birthday.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ * dear, Klairs Supple Preparation Facial toner: I've gone through umpteen of these and have learned that this is a product that's okay for me to have a back-up of. Every time I get cocky and take it out of my routine, I regret it.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ * CosRx Ultimate Moisturizing Honey Overnight Mask: when my skin is irritated, this makes a great soothing moisturizer. I usually use it as a moisturizer instead of a mask. I'm sure I'll RP down the road.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ * Amore Pacific Moisture Bound Rejuvenating Eye Treatment Gel: it pains my wallet to say that my eye area really likes AP eye gels and creams.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ * CosRx AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner: good riddance! I don't think I need a special pH-adjusting toner, especially as I don't use actives on a regular basis. I don't see myself RP anytime soon.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Here's what I destashed by giving to my sister: _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ * Holy Snails Spooky Shark Sauce: the first Shark Sauce that doesn't work for me. I think my skin hates turmeric, although my belly loves it.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ * Missha FTE: I still don't know if this broke me out or not, but I was tired of the uncertainty. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ * L'Herboflore Aqua Plus Moisture Peeling Gel: I bought two as a BOGO sale in Taiwan and am still working on the first one. I was stressed out trying to use up the other one before it expires next year, so I gave the unopened spare to my sister and feel so relieved! _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Here's what I have just chucked: _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ * Origins Dr. Weil Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief: This used to be my go-to product when my face would get chapped. The only reason I am tossing it is that I think it's expired as I've had it for years (I can't check the expiry date because the print on the bottle has worn off). I don't know if I'll ever RP, since I've found other products that are cheaper that also help.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_

Fans of MMA, myself included, are fucking weird.  It's the only major sport I have seen where people get really invested into knowing about fighters personal lives.  For example, Tom Brady and LeBron James are insanely massive in terms of renown.  Two of the absolute biggest there are.  Yet fans of MMA know way more about the outside of competition stuff of say Holm than NFL fans know about Brady.  It's harder to be objective as an MMA fan so sometimes we throw logic out the window.  We are all odd fans.

I kind of disagree. They say the cake is good but the icing is the problem implying Destiny 2 sits on a good foundation... I wholeheartedly disagree. So many systemic issues not to mention the core of the game, the gun play, feels significantly worse than D1.

I'm not gonna say you should jump back into it, but for me it actually was a bit of a trudge until I got near the end. Some really cool plot stuff I wasn't expecting happened, and it kinda retroactively demolishes the game's ludonarrative dissonance. Plus the difficulty level hit a nice, tense sweet spot for the entire final mission.
I second this, was going to pull the trigger tonight, but i just can't after seeing people complain about shortages and shake... hopefully losing potential costumers and/or current ones will help them get into gear and fix their problems.

Thanks for your help.  I'm aware of the YHWH and Elohim sources theory and was wondering if that had something to do with it or if it was two gods in the story.  As I've been reading Numbers, it's been pretty obvious to me when the P source is talking.  I'm sure there's no clear cut answers, but I'm hoping to see various options.  I'd like to read the story again with them in mind to see how they impact my understanding of it.

Not related to your questions, but I will check your videos, thanks for sharing! Do you talk about your business model and numbers? It would be interesting to see the perspective of someone that just started. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Now regarding your question. Holding mtg cards might have a return of 10% a year, but there is risk involved. Since you already have your own business, I suppose you can get a higher rate of return (greater than 10%), so it makes sense to sell whatever you have and invest in your business. If you manage to get more than 10% a year, then you can always buy the fetch lands back if you want to. Before making such decision, it is definitely worth to check the historical data on fetch land prices, and see what rate of returns have occurred in the past. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Good luck to yall!
I saw him last year at Santiago Bernabeu in Madrid. I basically wanted to hear two songs that he didn't sing at a previous concert that I attended to, and they were two of my favourites, The River and Thunder Road. Since it was The River Tour, obviously The River was going to be played, and he was doing Thunder Road in every single concert of the tour, so I took it for granted. But they did Born in the USA, and Born to Run, and Dancing in the dark, and he kept going and he finished with Twist and shout and no Thunder Road. I was so disappointed, almost in tears. And the band left the stage, I thought he left too, but he appeared with his guitar, started to say goodbye but he played that one chord that I recognized, and he played Thunder Road in acoustic. It was so beautiful I get chills when I remember it. He is amazing.
I find it hard to believe that the US can be more heightist than scandinavia. In scandinavia your height defines your whole social status. If anything heightism in the US is of scandinavian heritage. Things seem to still be much better in the rest of Europe though.

You said you’d prefer they not put on their try hard pants. That’s the same as saying you don’t want them to try. That’s what I had an issue with.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ You don’t get to dictate how other people enjoy the game or how they play. Similarly, they don’t get to dictate how you play. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It’s kind of you to play with the goal of making the game more fun for everyone, but there’s no requirement they do the same. It’s just something you need to live with.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ We can agree on one thing though, I think. Shit like BNP needs to be removed.

I keep seeing people saying it but I don't understand where the sentiment comes from. You don't want people to think you will shoot them, or that you like guns, what is it? I can see not wanting to wear it in an area after a mass shooting has happened but beyond that I don't think anyone really cares, it's just a shirt. I can't think of any shooters who have gone around advertising they shoot people with guns on their shirt.

It’s because they’re greedy pieces of shit that don’t care about the community, only money. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Lmao, so which is it, cosmetics make plenty of money, or EA didn't do cosmetics because they only care about money? You can't seriously be making both those arguments with a straight face. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Overwatch is boring as fuck and I have no reason to play it because there is literally no progression and I couldn't give two shits about cosmetics.

Deciding not to walk down an alley will not, however, prevent your girlfriend or your best friend from taking money from your wallet while you're in the shower.  It also won't prevent scammers from stealing your credit card info.  So there needs to be more than one focus on solving the problem of being mugged.  Likewise, when every discussion on how to prevent rape becomes about telling women how to dress, how to act, where to go and when, and how to beat off attackers, it does absolutely nothing at all to prevent instances of date rape or workplace sexual harassment or marital rape.  Women have been *learning from mistakes* for a long time now.  It has not stopped rape.  People who stress these 'preventative measures' seem to think that if every woman in the world did the exact right thing, wore the exact right thing, went the exact right places, and said the exact right phrases, then rape wouldn't happen.  But not only is that an unreasonable goal, it also implies that women who end up being raped anyway were somehow doing 'the wrong thing' and thus deserved their attack.  Do we chide the elderly for getting sucked into online email scams and losing all their savings with the same viciousness with which society chides women for wearing clothes other people might find attractive or drinking alcohol?  I think not.

What negative effects are you feeling? That same thing happened to me.

Hey man, thank you so much for your reply! It seems completely logical to take initiative and I'm really willing to do that... The only thing is... how?

Frieder thought he'd still get to coach in the tournament but Bo Schembechler basically told him to clean out his office because *Michigan will be coached by a Michigan Man!*   _back_to_line_    _back_to_line_ I feel like I've deflowered a virgin or something, surely an actual Michigan person should have done this.

Depends entirely on the cause and severity of visual snow.

I totally get that, but there are tons of ways to show personality without revealing major plot points. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Let's go back to Undertale's demo, since that's one a lot of people are familiar with. Without taking into account any spoilers or anything we learn about her past, what do we know about Toriel just from the demo? We quickly learn that she's protective and motherly, to the point of being smothering, but her heart is in the right place. She's formal, maybe a bit old-fashioned. She eats snails, which is strange and a bit funny to us, but seems to be normal for her. Judging by what she wrote in her diary, she has an interest in puns. She enjoys reading, cooking, gardening, and bug catching. She has always wanted to be a teacher. She keeps her house tidy. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Now, what do we know about Lore? He's... kinda normal? Likes his dog? Has a secret dark side that doesn't seem to be concerned about a ripped dog collar, but is later shown to have much interest in getting his dog back?  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ What about Binder? He's seemingly friendly, and very eccentric. How about Lore's father? Evil parent, likely abusive. The Artifact? A big negative jerk. Baron? Loyal, endlessly encouraging, positive, and more intelligent than you would expect a dog to be. Loves vikings. That's *something* for the dog, at least.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ We don't need backstory or shocking revelations to know something about a character. Even something as simple as knowing their interests can go a long way. In Heartbound, we get a whole lot of talking and almost no character. If they were going to leave out everyone's personalities for the demo, shouldn't they at least have kept talking to a minimum? That's how Oneshot pulls it off at the start. We don't see Niko's personality yet, but they also don't have long talks with anyone.

Hey just felt like butting in on this, listen man the issue with tinder is that’s superficial as fuck. People on it are out to meet other people, but they are also looking for the best reason to swipe left on you.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ On the description just write something that’s humorous and light hearted, that way when you match with someone you have all these things about yourself to talk about and share. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Concerning the pics, I’m with you man... Just don’t be too hard on yourself and have 2 maybe 3 pics max where you are happy with them. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Aside from that, take tinder with a grain of salt because it can be harsh. People judge other people for what they look like, if they have a dog or if they are at the beach with their friends. None of the above describe you for who you are and I take it you’re a cool guy.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Anyways, you sound bummed out... don’t let this shit bring you down

Just, what an excellent bit of homebrew! I love the little details used to convey the class's story. Little things like being able to use an inspiration die in the next hour is a small utility, but says a lot about the class. And I like all the features - the way to use inspiration dice with One's Own Pace is very interesting. Giving up a frantic all-in attack for some defensive boost, with the reaction attack added in to make it so your ally can still be active on their turn. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Slow and Steady is also useful and equally thematic, giving the Bard a great way to help the team, cementing the support role. And Ever Distant Dream maintains the concept, and is also a way to stay alive while still helping the team: suddenly, the healer doesn't need to panic about the Bard, because they'll be okay and can be left alone for one round. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I'm also a big fan of the type of character this design incentivizes. From my experience, the classic Bard is energetic, rambunctious, and sometimes even a little manic in their weirdness. This archetype encourages instead a Bard that is thoughtful, more poetic than performative, more bucolic than sanguine. One who might not always Inspire with a roaring song, but rather a quiet smile and a pat on the back. They're unworried about the fate of the world not out of carelessness, but out of confidence in their friends and themselves. They can do it. Just take it easy for a moment, and have hope.

I dont really know what the population is like either, but you many be able to find something. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The best suggestion I could make would be: _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ r/Persona5: [https://discord.gg/JRPG](https://discord.gg/JRPG) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ As of now there are no plans to make a discord server for the subreddit seeing as we are a smaller community here, but if it is something a large amount of people want, it is something that I will not say is impossible in the future.
Yes but when you do reactively trade with crypto you get astronomically higher profit than with stocks, and reliably at that. I made on average about 10% each week in this recent bull run and I lost maybe 1 or 2 trades in the past few months. When there's a downtrend and tons of panic selling you can really balloon your money, which is why I'm excited for these next couple of weeks. The advantage in crypto, being a trader, is that almost every other person in the market isn't. It makes it so incredibly lucrative if you know how to take advantage of it, the stock market just can't compare IMO.
Think the biggest error is assuming that it would cost nothing to help. It certainly would, but despite how little of a dent that it would make in their money, these are the people who won't do a single thing about it. 
Instead of Shark cards it'll be what... Gold bars? Seems more than plausible... _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ As a huge Star Wars fan not buying Battlefront was a difficult decision, thankfully single player reviews helped my resolve- If Red Dead 2 goes the same way as GTA5 I think I'll save my time for another game

Wasn't queer deemed offensive not so long ago? It's getting to the stage where you'd be safer traversing a minefield. I don't care who people are attracted to, as long as everyone involved is a consenting adult, but it's getting tedious keeping up with the ever changing terminology and acronyms.

Accidents happen in war and the more focus we place on regional actors solving these problems in their own backyard, often with mild US/Euro support, the more this is going to happen. We could debate for hours the various externalities of both regionalization of conflicts and of taking out terrorists through air power. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ As for /u/cancertime’s remark, that’s really questionable and you have to look at the multiple costs associated with any specific action or policy. You also have to look at the wider picture, from maintaining international stability, to keeping regional bad actors in line, to creating a hot zone to distract radicals and kill them (fighting them over there), to safeguarding global trade and shipping routes and encouraging economic and social development in these countries, to name a few. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ You want to paint with a broad brush that ‘Murcia is evil, because there is collateral damage in war. Yet you’ve overlooked the wider picture of how much worse the alternatives could be, both in these countries and internationally, if the United States abandoned the international stage. But please, keep talking about how America is *just as bad as the jihadists* who are stoning little girls to death for going to the schools that we built for them.

Yeah that's bananas. Whenever I hear anyone speaking Russian they sound like they're having as much fun as helping a Nigerian prince scam them so it's tough to gauge the conversation. 
Not only owning up to stupidity, but digging further into it. I sincerely hope you're just trolling for the sake of pissing off some rando on the internet, othewise it's just sad. You even carefully avoided the downvote button, in an attempt to show how superior your intellect is. I mean, just read your own posts again as if they weren't yours, appreciate fully how they come across, and reflect back on how miserable your life has to be currently to put this petty argument as a priority before basic logic and decency, or even before more important things in your own life even. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Sorry, I need to flush the toilet now, my time with you is over, but it's been a pleasure my dear  : -)

You can try to go to college, but if you don’t get accepted tough shit. We should start weeding out those individuals who don’t meet criteria earlier on in their educations. Take someone who doesn’t have the scores or grades, and put them in a trade school. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I have kids at my school who are geniuses in their own right. One of my former students is my auto mechanic. He can do anything dealing with an engine, lawnmower to foreign car. You put the math questions in front of him on how a car works, he’s shit his pants before he got an answer right. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Not everyone will be a Fortune 500 CEO, not everyone will be an engineer, we need plumbers, carpenters, and mechanics. 
A mesh will unavoidably have a greater latency. This is because each mesh node the message passes through must receive the message, make a routing decision (usually, but not always, by reading/parsing the header) and send the message. In a naive implementation, this will add one parse delay and one send delay per node in the chain. Practical implementations will also incur queue delay and (usually) partial copy cost.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Completely custom hardware can move the routing tables to specialty ram and begin the send as soon as the header is received and parsed, but there is nothing in this space available on the open market. This is possible, but very technically challenging, and reduces but does not eliminate the added latency. This is why a well designed mesh will always have a higher latency than a well designed traditional network.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Please note that all the statements above are abject lies in the interests of providing a useful answer The real answer in much more complex than this, but would likely not be useful to you.

Just started my enviro job (in NJ), so take what I say with a grain of salt. But at my job (mid-sized firm), there isn’t really any long-term travel. There’s only one site they’re going to send me to that’s a few hours away where I’ll have to stay for a few nights sometimes, but they said everyone is always home on the weekends. Other than that, all sites are pretty close by. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ NJ and Philly area are good places if you want an enviro job. I didn’t have much trouble finding mine and neither did my friends I graduated with. I like it a lot so far, but I’m very new.

You're clearly WAY more invested in this girl than she is you. She sees you as fun, uses you to get what she wants.

Go no contact, block her number, block her on any social media. Go out and meet people and do things you enjoy doing.

As someone who was a fan at first, the entire path of the Game/Screw Attack split and then going independent felt off to me. It felt like Craig was trying to blame RT for them not being as popular after the split, and then when they did talk shit about the rest of RT, it felt like they were hitting out of their league. There are several huge channels with strong bases, and your trying to swing on them when you can barely break 10k? Felt entirely disrespectful.
I want to say that there's a giant that did exactly that, actually. Hang on, I'll look for it.

It was definitely a risk to make a decision based on a trailer that very well could have ended up bad, but I’m glad that’s not the case. This has quickly became a favorite game of mine.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I’ve heard uncharted is good, so I’ll have to pick that up at some point. There are a couple other exclusives that are enticing as well; Last of Us, the new God of War, and No Man’s Sky (well, now that they’ve released enough patches to fix it). I’m sure there are others but I can’t recall them t the moment. 
Oh okay perfect thank you. Is there a specific supplier?

Government has been in bed with every economy. The only reason communism/socialism can even begin to exist is because government enforces it.

Maybe you could have communicated a little more, or asked about what she'd like, or whatever. But the point is you already agreed she'd set that time for you. If she wasn't certain, she could have asked you if you were planning anything or if she should expect anything.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Even if you give her the benefit of the doubt- maybe she didn't want to assume anything, maybe you didn't communicate enough- there's still the problem that she chose her friends over you. Given two choices, she chose them. It's her right, absolutely, but it reflects what she values more.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Personally, I would value an SO who made special plans for me. Unless her friend got her VIP tickets to her favorite thing or whatever? I'd still think really, REALLY hard before shitting all over my SO's lovingly-made plans.  _back_to_line_

I'd also say that your team will expect you to get picks comparable to Genji or Tracer and not just hack/EMP/use her passive to get critical heroes. Which is again unlike how pros play Sombra who usually farm her ult off tanks and keep them hacked as much as possible so they can't do much. Basically, your team won't think you're doing anything unless you show up in the kill feed a lot.

Hmmm, the part where Carver claims that all anti-authoritarians are liberals? I guess I see how that functions as an explanation, but I guess I just don't buy it – it seems to rule out more careful distinctions. Don't you think there's something anti-liberal about Marx's anti-individualism, anti-formalism, anti-bourgeois democracy, etc.? Or is that a presentist understanding of *liberal*?

This absolutely is a cherry-picked stat. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ We didn’t have a lead until October. We are constantly getting stupid penalties and drops that put us in “and long” situations. We don’t have Joe Thomas and our TEs aren’t good blockers. Our rushing numbers are also inflated because our QB has improvised well from time to time in passing situations. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Play-calling isn’t the problem people.

Before you break your arm patting yourself on the back, consider the fact that most of the technology you're using was first invented and developed by geniuses for whom a 4.0 or academic success in general was probably an afterthought. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ You're right, CS isn't coding, but coding isn't CS, either.

But rates don't stay low, that's the whole point... _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ That 100 billion Pound loan you take out at 0.25% interest today needs to be refinanced in 10 years at 5%, which suddenly becomes unaffordable and bankrupts the country. Unless you're suggesting we'll magically pay off all our loans in a few years and they'll never need to be refinanced?
Hmm, good point. Thinking back about it, I considered mobility a requirement in utility. Since in BGs, you rarely can do anything else other than attack. MCing a target is only good for a short distance and if you're lucky. Swap is situational and shield can easily pop. I rarely do any arenas, so it's all about bgs for me. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I dot everything, and then voidform in team fights. However, somehow I had completely forgot about focusing. Which you brought up. With all of these abilities, spriests are better off focusing a target into oblivion while doing some AOE dmg.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ What made it hard for me to feel more impactful was the lack of big damage or large crits.

I will definitely do it. That phrasing is amazing. _back_to_line_ He and I were both laid off last year and had to move in with her which makes this all the more difficult. He has agreed that when we move out early next year it would be best for my mental health to go NC with his family. Right now it's just stressful because he &amp; I are working more than ever to get out of debt to make this happen. But while we're working a ton, I get the benefit of more money &amp; not being at her house. On the flipside it means I see him much less and I'm exhausted from working so much. And when I do see him I have to split up the little time we have together not enjoying each other, but filled with running errands, laundry, etc. While I'm content to not speak with her, he feels compelled to at least be polite enough to ask about her day before he joins me. She usually comes up with 20 different ways to make the conversation last an hour or so. He hates it and feels like she's keeping him hostage, but he does it to keep the peace as much as possible.
In this podcast with Andrew Sullivan, dated August 12, 2014, Sam talks about *taqiyya*, which he claims is a doctrine of lying in Islam. You can perform a word search on this archived version of the transcript of the podcast: _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ https://web.archive.org/web/20140816201450/http:/www.samharris.org/blog/item/making-sense-of-gaza _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ As an exmuslim myself, I know that there is no such thing as taqiyya, that it is simply a conspiracy theory perpetuated by the alt-right. During his argument with Ben Affleck, Sam claimed to be *extremely well educated* with respect to Islam, so I am at a loss to explain how someone whop claims to be so well educated on the matter can get it so wrong...unless he knew that he was lying to his listeners. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The was obviously some backlash, because he later censored that part of the podcast from the transcript: _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ https://www.samharris.org/blog/item/making-sense-of-gaza _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Note how in this version, which still appears on his blog, he has removed any reference to taqiyya...as though he never said it. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Don't you think that it dishonest? L. Ron Hubbard used to do similar things in interviews. If he realised that something he said conflicted with something else, he would have all the tapes destroyed to ensure that the followers of Scientology always had a consistent message for their indoctrination.

This is stupid. Plenty of people aren't attracted to certain races. Asian people, black people, white people, Indian people. It doesn't matter. No one has to be attracted to every race or else their racist. That's absolutely ridiculous. I'm allowed to be attracted and unattracted to whoever the hell I want and as long as I treat everyone with decency and respect, I'm not racist.

That's pretty dominant if you ask me.

For good liquid liner you need a steady hand and properly shaped eyes/eyelids, neither of which determine your femininity.

His mother suffered from depression, and was verbally/emotionally abusive during their childhood. He also had a stepfather who was physically and verbally abusive. His birth father left him and his siblings at a young age for another woman. While he was and is still in their lives, I get the sense that while the father tried to be around as much as he could, he wasn't around a lot and couldn't provide the most structure for them. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ His siblings tell me that he was in an abusive romantic relationship before me. However, that is only one side of the story. Although he is the yougner male, he is the scion of the family and really a 'golden child'; very talented, brilliant, smart, funny, liked by everyone and respected. He has a very good image (and honestly, he is a good person, he has a good heart).  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  I know that he's hurting, when he rages like this. I still love him, and I tell him I love him, that I hear him, that I still respect him. I try make it so he has a safe place to come back to.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I'm not a controlling person, as I believe things should come freely or they don't mean anything. I hate manipulation. However, I feel like I'm becomign more and more passive aggressive because I'm insecure in this relationship and unable to vocalize myself. I'm trying ot keep this and the anxiety etc in check because I know those things make him feel unsafe. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ My depression/anxiety makes him feel like he's walking on eggshells too. He used to say he was. I don't want to make him feel that way. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ What kept you in love with your wife? How did you manage to come back to a loving place?  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I didn't say this in my post as I forgot, but to be honest, I feel like his rage is killing his love for me. He keeps feeding resentment and it's eating away at the trust and respect he has for me as a SO and a person. I know I'm definitely not perfect and have a lot of work to do. 
You think all this talk about UBI came out of nowhere and not because within 5 years there will be millions of jobs automated?

Our current welfare system will not support these people.

It’s people like you that are dumb enough to pay inflated prices, so they keep going up. _back_to_line_ So you don’t deserve medical attention, because you can’t afford it. _back_to_line_ Does not matter if price is ridiculous, it’s your fault for not having enough, now you go without. _back_to_line_ Just a complete fucking idiot.
If you're using a *fully forgetting* version of tails it would need to be done with each boot.  Agreed it would be much better if it was built in. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The nice thing is that the newer electrum versions seem to work, it just needs to get bundled.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If I'm understanding the process right, it needs to be bumped up in Debian from TESTING to STABLE.  Then we probably need a new Tails release after that. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/electrum _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Or someone could build a custom tails distro with the newer Electrum version.  But I wouldn't trust a custom distro (specific for bitcoin users) that they didn't put something malicious in it to steal private keys.

Hippos certainly help, as they add level skips. Every level you skip adds to your medals a minute. I've found that in order to increase Sr efficiency you need to watch the game like a hound.

The higher you start the more medals a minute you can potentially have. 
Lack of fixing was definitely a thing in Alara, with only the Panoramas, Obelisks, and Trilands. You can tell WotC tried very hard to add more fixing in Conflux and especially in Reborn (landcycling + Borderposts).

From my limited knowledge of Catholicism. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Pope ~ Prophet _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Cardinal ~ Apostle / General Seventy _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Archbishop ~ Area Seventy _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Bishop ~ Stake President _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Priest ~ Bishop _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Of course these equivalencies are wrong. The churches structures don't line up very neatly. And its important to realise the Catholics exist in far greater numbers then the Mormons. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ And the Catholic structure is not as authoritarian as the Mormon structure. Its entirely possible for local leaders to take a different stance to the Pope on local issues. Unlike the Mormon system of 'What works for white American's will work for everybody'.
Yeah, I still see him downtown scamming during the lunch hour. He's not as aggressive as he used to be though. I'm pretty sure he's living in section 8 housing in old town.
Except that irradiance decreases with the inverse square of distance and you probably quite a bit further from your TV than you do from your phone when you're using it. That means orders of magnitude less light actually enters your eye from the TV.

That is a great point about the last roadmap.  I too was watching when it dropped and even yesterday was THIS close to dropping my coins at 10 cents to buy back in and make a killing!!!

It's spam, and worse, it's nonsense. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ This article by Murch (BitGo engineer) that corrected a lot of his *assumptions* he made to come up with his whack theory in the first place: _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ https://medium.com/@murchandamus/i-have-just-read-jonald-fyookballs-article-https-medium-com-jonaldfyookball-mathematical-fd112d13737a _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ There was a followup article by u/jstolfi (who let's recall [doesn't believe in bitcoin](https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-batsbzx-2016-30/batsbzx201630-2.htm) and thinks it's [theft](http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~stolfi/bitcoin/2014-02-17-HowToMakeSomeEasyMoney.html)) with this challenge: _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6jxem4/responding_to_murchs_responding_to_jonald/ _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; There is a very simple way to shut criticisms like Jonald's and mine. Just provide a hypothetical scenario for 10 million users with topology and numbers -- how many customers, merchants, and hubs, how many channels and payments (per day or per month) per user for each pair of those user classes, and how much bitcoin each user commits to his channels, etc. Then anyone who doubts the viability of the LN can simulate it with those data, and conclude for himself. Any takers for this challenge? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Diane Reynolds took up his challenge (which to be fair is a stupid challenge, but she proved him wrong anyway): _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ https://hackernoon.com/simulating-a-decentralized-lightning-network-with-10-million-users-9a8b5930fa7a _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; We have given a structure for a lightning network with 10 million users which has no centralized hubs. Indeed each user has exactly the same connectivity and funding as all other users. While this is not how a lightning network would be expected to evolve in a real world scenario, it does show that it is technically possible to have such a network. In addition we have given code to simulate making payments in the network. A relatively short run (attempting 400,000 payments) shows that payments succeed 99% of the time, failing more often for micropayments than larger payments.

Is it commitment to equality or is it a people bound by blood to face their destiny?  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The fact that in this dispute, we favor us and they favor them is not the interesting difference. However, since tribalism is demonized, it's the thing you're supposed to pick up on.

&gt;entiendo todos tus puntos dado que vivo encontrandome con esos casos todo el tiempo, pero la gente (perdon por decirlo) suele ser muy boluda con el tema y en ves de ser prácticos hacen todo lo opuesto. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Acepto cualquier sugerencia practica que tengas para obligarlos a hacer cumplir la ley y a prestar el servicio como corresponde. No te acepto *andate a otro lado a alquilar*. Si administras una inmobiliaria debes tener claro que no es tan facil por lo que puse mas arriba. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;otro ejemplo que veo mucho en el sub es que viven quejandose de la inmobiliaria esto y lo otro, y despues terminan contratando a la peor inmobiliaria de la zona que te negrea hasta el tuje pero bien que van ahi porque no son capaces de las garantias o cubrir los costos de alquilar en un lugar correcto. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Tengo todo en regla. Como te dije anteriormente, voy a una inmobiliaria por la propiedad, no por la inmobiliaria en si, mas alla de que si algo es muy turbio no alquilo. Y como te dije, esta es una de las inmos mas grandes que hay en la zona.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Desde mi punto de vista me como todos los pijazos que hay y por eso puteo. Yo cumplo con mis obligaciones en tiempo y forma pero la inmobiliaria no presta el servicio que deberia prestar y me cobra como si lo hiciera. Si pasa algo, las soluciones se demoran muchisimo. El dueño idem a la inmo. Ademas de todo esto tengo que entregar cualquier cantidad de papeles para alquilar, porque existen un monton de inquilinos lisa y llanamente pelotudos que destruyen los lugares que alquilan o directamente los usurpan. Son papeles que puedo conseguir y garantías que puedo dar, pero no deja de romperme los huevos, porque a fin de cuentas yo demuestro que voy a cumplir con mis obligaciones, las cumplo, y despues las demas partes contractuales hacen su parte a medias.

&gt; No i dont, ive just looked over the changes myself, and they wouldnt conflict with anything. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I'm sorry but without having access to their code how could even remotely claim to know that? Software development doesn't work they way you think it does. Suffice to say making such major changes to the back end networking is not some drag and drop thing like you seem to think, I don't know what else to tell you. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; Its not a 'no no', its very much legal and done all the time in the USA. Ever seen a coke in a Pepsi ad ? Ya. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Coke is not Pepsi's customer, they're a competitor and that's completely different. Coke hasn't paid Pepsi potentially millions of dollars for it's services as Bluehole has probably paid Epic by now. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ When you have two businesses that have a working relationship you check with each other before you issue a press release with the others name in it, full stop. Any company will want to make sure it doesn't interfere with any of their campaigns and suits their own messaging and brand. If you don't I guarantee that you will be receiving an angry phone call the next day from them and with good cause. I've worked with PR departments responsible for preparing media campaigns with major brands and you triple and quadruple check anytime you want to use a customers name. If I'm paying you hundreds of thousands of dollars or millions of dollars a year I expect you to not trade on my brands recognition without checking with me first. Chances are  they'll be fine with the free press but they still want to run it past their own people first. If you want angry customers just do what Epic did in this case. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Now Epic knew that releasing a battle royale mode for Fortenite would piss Bluehole off. They did the math and figured they could make more money with Fortnite and that it's not like Bluehole can change engines at this point. It was a dick move and Epic knew Bluehole would be pissed off, any company would be. Releasing a product competing with a customer is bound to ruffle their feathers but a line was crossed was when they started name dropping PUBG in press materials without asking to try and trade on PUBG's notoriety. Notice how they knocked that off pretty quick? Ya. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Edit: And I never said it was illegal, I said it would piss customers off and it very much does. If you want to keep your customers as customers and get new ones using their name without checking is a bad way to do so. When you feel like a partner is untrustworthy and doesn't run things by you first you might start thinking whether you want to continue working with them and paying them money.

Not really no. Maybe Obama had 0 knowledge of anything going on in the justice department during the campaign, but the Trump campaign *was* put under surveillance and the justification to do it came in part from the democratic campaign purchasing opposition research from a foreign spy, and the results of that survellience was leaked to the media. That is actually quite troubling to me - more so then how technically correct his tweet is. So if its a lie, it's not the biggest issue we need to address regarding that whole thing.

The way I define right wing (and the way the vast majority of people define it) is that the Right opposes egalitarianism and supports traditional hierarchy. Obviously this can include support for individual freedom over social equality, but it doesn't have to. It also includes support for monarchism, racial nationalism, theocracy, traditional gender roles, and other forms of hierarchy. So yes, both radical anarcho-libertarians and authoritarian monarchists are right wing because they prioritize some social value over egalitarianism.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Leftist movements--even very hierarchical and authoritarian ones--tend to justify themselves by appealing to equality as the highest value, at least in theory, and the ultimate goal of their political and social project. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The Alt Right strongly opposes the mainstream conservative movement, but it clearly views itself as right wing. There was an excellent book written by a political science professor just prior to Trump's election which discussed where on the political spectrum the Alt Right should be categorized. Here is a review of that book in an Alt Right/white nationalist publication.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ [Key Quote](https://www.counter-currents.com/2016/05/right-wing-critics-of-american-conservatism/) from the Alt Right reviewer:  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *The Right does not regard equality as the highest political value, although there is a range of opinions about what belongs in that place (pp. 11-12). Libertarians, for instance, regard individual liberty as more important than equality. White Nationalists think that both liberty and equality have some value, but racial health and progress trump them both.* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Hope this helps clear up any confusion.

Oh, I messed up the link, I guess. Whoops. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I've never personally tried it, but I've never heard anything good about it from someone who doesn't sell it. Even if it was a great, reasonably priced product, I'd avoid it. MLMs are such scammy, awful pyramid schemes that I use every opportunity I can to steer people far away from them. (If you're interested, r/antiMLM is a great sub that causes laughter, anger, cringing, and so much more!) _back_to_line_ Oh, and there's also a chance that something like [this](https://np.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/7dhsej/just_saw_this_tweet_thought_yall_would_be/) could happen. _back_to_line_ As far as I know, the results you get with any eyelash serum fade when you stop using it. I don't think dropping one from your routine would cause any damage. It seems like a safer route than getting extensions, which can definitely cause damage/breakage and look pretty bad between fill-ins. Just please, please don't buy from R+F. Buying from MLMs doesn't *support* the person you buy from; the best way to truly support a victim of MLM is to encourage them to keep track of their finances so that they realize how much money they're losing because of their cult company. The faster they get out, the less destroyed their finances/relationships will be.

Another help for thought: The argument for *rockets work in vacuum because Newton* often brings up high velocity as if that would be a factor. But no matter how fast the chemical reaction is it still have to have something to build up pressure against and that cannot be itself. Imagine bringing down the reaction into slow motion. Each molecule will slowly drift away maybe bounce into something but then find the direction where it will float away into the endless vaccum of space. No interaction. No pressure buildup.

I made a proxy cube. I sleeved a bunch of bulk commons, printed out the proxies with a color printer on normal paper, used a paper cutter to cut everything out, and stuck the paper in front of the sleeved cards. It cost like $40 for the sleeves, $25 for a paper cutter, and I used the color printer at my work for free. The process of cutting and sleeving took a few hours, but I broke it up into several sessions.

I don't know that much about Tulsa tbh, but I was looking up their softball facilities a few weeks ago for a post on our team's sub (it's a long story but they're the only other G5 top 25 softball team).

Read a memoir by a rookie detective who was tasked with investigating a possible serial killer. As the case dragged on for years with zero progress, she eventually got the extra manpower she had been arguing for. But the new cops on the case fixated on the wrong suspect and intentionally withheld evidence from the lead investigator in the hope of taking credit for *their* collar. In the mean time, dozens of prostitutes were brutally murdered. One of their aunties, working alone with no resources at all, managed to identify the killer and locate the scene of the crimes, but was ignored by police, who failed to arrest the man for a couple more years. During the investigation, a victim managed to escape with multiple stab wounds, ending up being treated in the same hospital as the killer (she had stabbed him back), and the police let him go free without charges.  A friend of the killer reported him to police, and they still made no arrests. Anyway, the writer ended up with PTSD, and I almost got it myself from reading her book.

Note that when Odium confronts Taravangian, something very important happens - Taravangian notices small blacked-out letters on the Diagram spelling out *Renarin Kholin*. It is heavily implied that Odium has overlooked these words, because they aren't gold in the vision (his color), and there's stated to be a *ripple* there which may mean it's obscured from Odium. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The implication is that genius-level Taravangian anticipated all of this. He knew that Odium would only come when he was dumb, so he even included words for the dumb version of himself to read, making a pact with Odium. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I am almost certain that genius-Taravangian planned to make a pact with Odium and then betray him. After all, Odium is bound to his oaths, whereas Taravangian isn't - he'd have to be a fool not to realize that this results in an enormous advantage over Odium. And because Odium will only make terms with Taravangian when he's in idiot-mode, he can't read his mind to discover the duplicity. It's a really brilliant move on Cultivation's part to set things up like this. I appreciate that between Taravangian, Lift, Nightblood, and Dalinar's *pruning*, she is definitely making provisions to beat Odium.

We have a small-business oriented liquor licensing system that permits only one liquor license per entity.

This is what I've observed at the Boise one. There are local tunnel car washes all over that are much better. I use the $5 off coupon that comes in the mail at Mister, which makes their best wash $10.

It started off alright though because it wasn't too in your face. It made whatever point it had while also being funny. The recent seasons don't do that anymore, they forego any entertainment and just straight preach at you. Don't see how anyone can find that enjoyable.

Im also a joust player with over 1k games played. First of all, putting on mp5 wouldn't help the fact that most support items don't have much options for mp5. And also, upgrading his 1 is so pointless the fact that it cost so much for a little increase for his drunk%. It makes no sense to have an item do worse when its upgraded. Also like Get_Rawur said, Hercules heal gives him 15 protections more then Bacchus's and its only 60 mana! His passive also gives him power like Bacchus's and he can also build Transcendence which gives him more mana and mp5. The magic power version of Trans. is Book Of Thoth which would make no sense for Bacchus. Decreasing the mana cost would make his 1 actually useful to level up.

For non-international actors such as ISIS you might be right, hardcore authoritarian regimes are also not caring that much, but drmocratic states come under A LOT of scrutiny for violating the laws of war.

[This](https://imgur.com/7AQBRVV) might be relevant. It's a bit plain, but then my character was basically a brun this year. My tent set up for Bicolline 2017. The crate is an un decorated craft store purchase. [Micheals](http://www.michaels.com/wood-crafts-and-supplies/crates-and-boxes/918013462) sells them online. The chest came from a store that no longer exists, but the smaller ones from Micheals might work better for your group, especially if you decorate them in styles very distinct to each persona. A roll of burlap conceals my duffel bag and the cot. A military surplus woolen blanket covers my very modern sleeping bag. The woolen blanket is great as functional decor as well. It goes with any time period, and it's fairly warm. Oh and a cheap carpet from Wayfair. It was on sale for $70. Which sounds like a lot, but when you've been camping for a week, that small patch of plush carpet feels luxurious. Or you can get 14 cheap woven rugs from [FiveBelow](https://www.fivebelow.com/room/rugs.html) for the same amount... So maybe try there first.

Pretty much. I think young people were an easy target for these alt-right types to recruit. Think about it, since the average 18 year old has been politically aware there has been a Democrat in office. They are typical American youth, mostly disenfranchised and feel hopeless and held down. None of them even remember what the GOP does when they have control. To them it must be the Left making things suck so they go hard right just to be edgy and buck the system. Makes for a perfect shit storm.

In this case I would just creep the map until teir 2 and stifle any creeping that they can do if possible. If they are just harassing your base while they tech, then make a coupel towers and creep the map.

That’s interesting. I found the beginning of Season 4 with the virus in the prison a bit boring really.

This just legitimately made me smile to read. I have moments now and again where the workload feel insurmountable, and I become overwhelmed and disheartened — but I have plenty of people in my life that work different avenues of the entertainment industry with me, and they all unanimously agree, “if you don’t show up or aren’t there, you aren’t able to seize the opportunity.” _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It does sometimes seem like there’s no bottom or safety net, but the freedom that comes with the calamity all seems worthwhile, nonetheless.

The new lore suggests there are five Darkin. I honestly doubt that Riot has plans for all the future Darkin. I'm really disappointed that they chose to gut Varus when they could have kept his old lore intact and save their new lore ideas for a new champ-who could have abilities directly related to the three minds in one body. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Like I'm just throwing ideas out but why not have a Darkin champ have two forms, one in combat and one out of combat. When out of combat the Hunters take over and the champion can have movement, stealth or supporting skills. When they enter combat the Darkin takes over and their skills become combat oriented. Something like that would directly work with multiple minds in one body, instead of just saying the guy with a bow has three people jammed in there.

I've never heard of this concept. I have heard if rolling joint with a rose petal as the paper for the nice flavor and aroma. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I guess this isn't popular in the areas where I have lived (Western Washington and Northern California) because weed is so abundant here in all different strains. It's really easy, especially with legal/medical weed, to get the exact strain you want, and a lot of them are known for flavors (my friend told me the flavor comes from terpenes, but I don't really care about the science behind it). There's blueberry, orange, lavender, etc... -flavored weed. My friend grew banana kush, there's lemon OG, etc.... _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I've also heard of people going to hookah bars and mixing weed into the sheesha or w/e (called making a dirty bowl). _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ But as far as flavoring plain weed, I'm sure mixing in spices is harmless because it's like a tobacco blend. But I highly DON'T recommend honey because you would be burning sugar, and that would be bad smoke haha _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_

Speaking of evidence:   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I try not to stick with observable behaviors, so I was not suggesting that Bernie or Reich was a sheep dog, which, I think speaks to intent.

Bernie also endorsed her after the California primary. So, I'm not sure how Reich's conduct disqualifies him from serving with Bernie.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ ETA:  I am not dissing Bernie.

Here I copied and pasted this guys technical analysis from TradingView.com.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ “There are a lot of haters and naysayers of DGB on various forums and Twitter. Many of these people are disgruntled because they bought into DGB at an all time high and sold at or near the bottom. In response to their loss, they smear the reputation of DGB with false information. It seems rather foolish to take them seriously.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ We don't buy at peaks and sell at the bottom. Rather, we accumulate a strong position at the bottom and take profits along the way when there is significant upward movement. We reenter the market on dips for long term positions for gains in the future.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Multitudes of people are complaining about the current price of DGB. Don't pay attention to those who only consider the satoshi value of DGB. They don't understand triangulation. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The current price of DGB in USD is 69 times greater than in March of this year. And, we are at the bottom according to market sentiment.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Furthermore, we will be at $1 per DGB by Nov of 2018 if and only if we stay in the orange triangle. We've touched each side of the ascending triangle twice thus far. Additionally, we will be at $10 in May of 2019 if we respect the right leg of triangle. Of course, prediction fails should we break below right leg of triangle. Our ultimate target lies in the blue box which ranges from $1 - $10.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Don't be like the masses who ignore the fundamentals of this digital asset.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ We have already solved the scaling issues that plagues BTC since our block size doubles every two years. We are currently processing 560 transactions per second. By 2035, we'll be able to process 280,000 TPS.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ With DGB, transactions are confirmed and spendable in about 6 minutes or less. People who claim speed does not matter have swallowed a pill called delusion. Think about it. You can send DGB             to anyone in the world for about one cent and that money is spendable in 6 minutes. The value proposition lies within its technology.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ DGB pioneered digishield which is utilized in 25 different altcoins. The difficulty to mine adjusts in real time to prevent a malicious attack. Mining is super decentralized since the DGB blockchain is on 100,000+ nodes. DGB uses five algorithms which provides security for the network. DGB is planning on swapping an algorithm in the near future to prevent ASIC centralization.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ DGB is in the process of being added to Ledger so that users have a hardware wallet to store their digibytes.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The DGB team provides constant updates on Twitter and Telegram channels so that investors can stay informed. Further, Jared Tate, the founder of DGB, is in the process of establishing a DGB foundation which will allow for significant growth.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ A solid foundation has been established with respect to the technology of DGB. Now, real world applications can be built upon the DGB blockchain. Developers are needed in this area!  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ We are great for processing micro transactions since our supply will be 21 billion by 2035. But, the use cases go far beyond payment processing. The focus of DGB is on cyber security which is the focal point for blockchain applications.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ DGB is making an effort to get onto Coinbase. This has serious implications for price growth since people would be able to buy DGB directly with USD.” -crypto_gunther  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Edit: Formatting

I purposefully chose to not turn in a big essay in highschool since I was unhappy with the quality.  The teacher had scene that I had a full draft at one point, but I thought it was trash and didn’t really say enough. So I skipped out on turning it in, and completely rewrote it, preferring to take the hit to my grade than turn in something I felt was meaningless. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 3 weeks later my teacher comes to me distraught and tells me she lost my essay, and she’s never lost an essay before and she’s really sorry. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I just end up saying oh no it’s not your fault, I’ll go print another one out for you. Ended up getting a 97 on the essay. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I’m still not sure if that was unethical of me considering that I turned in an essay with an extra week of solid work put in and let her believe she did something she did not do, or divine favor giving me a second chance.

Perhaps I should change my wording in my original post. But I'm saying that there are many men in sports media (maybe ladies too, I don't know) who use their slight *clout* to make moves on fans &amp; people they barely know and I view that as predatory as they're the ones in the position of *power*. So when I hear news like this, I'm not surprised.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ **edit 2**: not saying hitting on fans = automatic sexual harassment.

I just turned 18 and I've noticed that I always enjoyed my alone time over going out with people one calls *friends*. However, I must say that I did not do this because I was scared/afraid of them or of what may happen or whatnot, but because I lacked interest. Also, I didn't trust them. Anyways, this is also something I don't understand, and maybe you can help me define it better, but is anxiety having *fear* overall about something specific, or what is it? Quite surprisingly, I was diagnosed with anxiety, which I don't agree with because i do not fear society. One exception though is the fact that I experience panic symptoms during presentations. My voice breaks and I don't know why, no matter how hard I try. Maybe I unconsciously do have social anxiety.

One book I can't recommend enough is Children of Time by Adrian Tchaikovsky. Anything by Mark Lawrence is good, he has a few series that brush each other. Seveneves by Neal Stephenson is one l liked. I think it had more potential but definitely worth the read/listen. The Worthing Saga by Orson Scott Card is one of my favorites that I've listened to multiple times, it has some philosophical implications and a pretty good story.

Yeah, that is brutal.

Well yes, but the two are related. You are right I mistakenly assumed that economic growth will help reduce the debt. Though this may be indirectly true through larger profits resulting in larger taxes, it would need to be proven. In any case, my point still stands that I haven't seen evidence for a ballooning debt as a result of Trump's decisions in office, among the other points I mentioned in my OP.

Disrupting a church offends just about anyone. People are going to assume Jones approved of this regardless of whether he did or not. I'm not from Alabama, I'm glad I don't have to wade through this mess, but I could see how people would choose not to believe the allegations based on the absolute circus surrounding it. The timing of the allegations stinks of political opportunism.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I know people wonder why do people believe Franken's accusers but not Moore's and the timing and circus like atmosphere is why. Franken is in a safe seat. He's not running for election right now. Nobody connected to a political campaign is outing this guy. Celebrity attorneys aren't representing his accusers. Given this, I hope people can see why Moore's supporters are skeptical. As for me, I really don't know. I know Trump didn't support this guy or campaign for him and this might be why. I also know that if Moore is not allowed to join the senate then the gov of Alabama will replace him with another Republican. I can see some people voting for him for that reason alone.

Okay, I was in a Stryker BCT back in the day during the surge.  I'll tell you how things are with the Strykers. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If you think of a Stryker as a thinner-skinned, under-gunned Bradley, you're doing it wrong.  Think of it as a Humvee on steroids.  It's roomier, faster, quieter, far better armored, and carries the same weapons (M2 or Mk 19) on an RWS, which is a serious force multiplier and observation system.  A platoon only requires four of them, minimizing the number of soldiers you have to leave behind in the vehicles on a mission - really you can operate with only three of them if you have to. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ So Stryker units are not heavy infantry like Bradley units.  I've heard the term *medium infantry* used to describe them, but in reality they're best used as light infantry with better vehicles.  I know of nowhere that a Humvee can get to that a Stryker can't, except for very narrow alleys in urban environments - which are going to be sheer hell for Humvees anyway; if your alley is so narrow that a Humvee can get through it but not a Stryker, you have no business taking a Humvee down that alley to begin with; you'll be getting a grenade or molotov cocktail dropped down through the gunner's hatch if you aren't lucky. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Treat a Stryker platoon as a light infantry platoon with better firepower.  More room to stow an AT8 or two on the roof, more room to store a case of MREs up top, etc.  Fucking *dismount* often.  If you have worries about IEDs, dismount. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; To an outsider it seems like Strykers are too large or cumbersome for use in mountains or jungles... _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ So are Humvees.  So is literally any vehicle you can think of.  Mountains and jungles aren't meant for vehicles unless you wanna count donkeys as vehicles. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; To an outsider it seems like Strykers are too large or cumbersome for use in mountains or jungles, and are too poorly armored or armed to fight in a conventional war against tanks. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If *any* infantry BCT is expecting to face an armored brigade, my response would be to look for either urban terrain or at least broken terrain, and set up a good defensive position.  Infantry are a real problem for unsupported tanks, but of course at the BDE level, the tanks have supporting infantry.  The best you can do in that situation is get a good defensive position as force multiplier, unless you've got air support available to chew up enemy vehicles.
Nothing had made sense all morning. I kept bumping into things around the house but I could pass that off to being up early, misplacing my glasses, or not having had any coffee yet.  _back_to_line_ Still, as I sipped the first cup, there remained an impending sense of wrongness. Had I forgotten a shift at work? A bill? Had I gotten drunk and murdered someone? _back_to_line_ My head was pounding. I groaned and headed for the shower, hoping the hot water would clear my head. As the water warmed and I stepped out of my clothes, I noticed even the fabric and fit of them was just.... off.  _back_to_line_ I stepped into the shower and sighed in relief. This was normal, on a day when nothing else was. I began to lather shampoo, trying to figure out why my hair felt weird, and shrugged it off to a weird moment of disassociation. I looked down as I rinsed, and suddenly I couldn’t hear the water or feel the heat.  _back_to_line_ My ears were rushing and I reviewed what I knew for sure as my world was shaken to the core.  _back_to_line_ &lt;I&gt;My name is Cassandra, I am 24...&lt;\i&gt; _back_to_line_  ....and I definitely did not have a penis last night.

Please from all my heart SHG, add these 4 streaks to the game: _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ -Advanced recon plane _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ -K9 unit _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ -Specialist bonus from mw3(one of the highest streaks, grants you all Perks in the game once you get it until you die. lasts for 1 life only) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ -Juggernaut kind off with and a Browning LMG from the campaign _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ All streaks so far have been either an obvious uav/care package or an airstrike _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Above powerful streaks, we need them to be fun and with a lot of variety  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ ALSO SAWED OFF SHOTGUN AKIMBO(Maybe make it a secondary)

well, the Dutch are possibly the complete opposite of the English in this regard. As straight to the point as you can be. After living in the UK for some years, I must say I prefer this over the English way. Sometimes it is just tiresome to second guess what their real intentions and opinion is. Better having the naked truth like an adult.
How do you know these aren't carrying 6.5 or 6.8 in some telescoped, caseless version?
Thanks for the encouragement! It’s such an annoyance when I thought I was going to kill two birds with one stone today... a half day off work for two appointments. Now I’ve wasted today, and have to reschedule both appointments for different days next week since I can’t coordinate them together again. But that’s all it is, an annoyance, not the end of the world. IWNDWYT
It's great to visit but stuff living there.
Likewise 
If you want stable pay and stable work, you have to get licences or certificates or endorsements. Long gone are the days of walking into a place and walking out with a job. These days they want you to have school, experience putting up with shit, new fresh ideas and they want to pay you 13$ an hour to do it. That's life, if you want better you have to literally cut out all the fun in your life, sacrifice all the chippies and pop and live like a monk. I guarantee you, you can save enough doing that to upgrade your low end blue collar to a medium blue collar with some bells and whistles. Jobs don't grow on job trees, and if they do, it's a tree you planted.

I've heard in other threads that a spill would allow the hard right within the party to delay the passage of SSM through the HOR, is this true?
To be honest, I couldn't care less about the reviews this time. Every new U2 album is granted the same review from the same outlets. There's no point paying attention to any of them. I love this album. That is enough 
How much are they even worth?
All units are useful, whether as units themselves or as fodder. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I could use more Barsts for example because Reposition is that useful.
How's education there? Does PG have any top 20 elementary and high school? Just curious. 
Oh yeah. We're embarrassing the nation, even though conservatives willingly elect people like Donald Trump into office and support child molesters like Roy Moore.

Yet again, your entire argument is refuted by the fact that most men aren't Chads, yet most men eventually get married. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ You try to say that the women want Chads instead, but you have no way of knowing that.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ When even statistics can't prove your false point wrong in your eyes, why do you even try to debate on the topic? You obviously won't accept anything other than what you and your incel buddies made up.
&gt; So you think people become gender critical so they can be popular on small internet subgroups of other gender critical feminists. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ No, that particular dynamic occurs only after they've already become gender critical and are part of that subgroup, and the way you phrase it makes it sound like a reasoned process, which it is not. It's very instinctive, which is why it is so widespread. People wouldn't actually be doing it if they stopped to think about it (except if they're oversensitive like me, but then they'd know that at least)
I think Trump got about 53% of the white woman vote in the entire country. For just Alabama specifically, I'd be very surprised if Moore only gets that number from white women. 
I love playing aggressive in solos! I've had 14 kills a couple of times. Would have been 15 if I killed the last guy lol _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If I play really conservative I win more but I don't do it that often 
[ONE did say he’s planning on updating Mob Psycho 100 during its usual schedule, but the MangaONE app is currently down due to maintenance.](https://twitter.com/one_rakugaki/status/936183327593193472) Some people on Tumblr are also saying that they can’t seem to access the app right now/the latest Mob Psycho content they’re seeing is last week’s omake, so I guess we have to wait a little more for the raws.
Ranked, after your placement matches, places you against players of similar skill level. Its up to you when you want to play, but it's best to get wait until you have somewhat decent map knowledge and operator knowledge, like knowing what each operator does, how to play operators and where to place gadgets etc. That way you'll know how to play and counter operators, how to travel through the map quickly,  where to place gadgets and learn about most commonly used entry points. Aim, awareness and game knowledge make up most of the game. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Best to try out different operators, and if there's one that your particularly like, you can try using that one more often than others. I main IQ and I'm used to her gadget/guns so I do better with her. 
wow. you guys will just believe anything..... you dont need hi fidelity to notice multiple guns shooting. you just need a brain and ears
i'll make a post tomorrow to sort all this out _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ it'll probably be something like *post in this new thread if you want to make a new vote, otherwise just leave your old vote in the old thread*
Lucky you (*disgruntled I don't have your luck*)
The fact that you're so concerned about what other people think is telling. If it's so important, then pursue it yourself. Literally no one else cares. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ This is one of the aspects of projection you really don't get. I'm beginning to think you never will. Fortunately, I, like everyone else, don't care either way.
Like dick down one leg, balls down the other. That can’t be comfortable 
He has.
I had 20$ and got to around 120$(i dedicated it not for gambling) and put like 3 keys in to gamble and got to another 50$ from it and i cashed out all and still have around 35-40$ before price drop(it was originally 20$ but from free things on sites i got 20$ which is insane)
Every sign points to us winning this game handily. So I don't know why I'm so antsy 
You know he went to the Wharton school, right? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Because he did, and many people say it's very prestigious.
Yeah it'd sure be nice if they'd swing the pendulum in the other direction for even just one day. It's been 1.5 straight years now of having low quality matches locked in INSTANTLY.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ My competitive queues are not even 10 seconds in many cases. I don't give a fuck if Little Johnny 14-Year-Old can't wait 30 seconds. It ruins the integrity of the entire game to have instaqueues for low-quality matches.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Sure, if the queues were 10+ minutes I'd be in absolute agreement that maybe we could take a 10% quality hit to bring that shit down to 5 minutes, but 5-7 minute queues to ensure a close fuckin' game even 30% of the time would be grand.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Right now, you have to play for 8+ hours to get one close well-matched game (in the Masters bracket, anyway). If I wanted fast unbalanced games, I'd play QP. If I want slower balanced games, that's *the entire purpose of competitive*.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Season after season we are getting instalock games with a huge balance disparity. Would be nice if even just ONE season we got balanced games with 5-7 minute queues.
Sure... _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I choose Yoshi !

Beat me to it Wiz. I always enjoyed watching him at Hawthorn and I was over the fuckin moon when he signed for us. He's always doing ridiculous stuff too, from 10 goals vs Carlton to running 75m (I think) from our back 50 to slot it vs Adelaide

The parts where you call people on the right ignorant and oppressive, and the part where you say anyone with half a brain is on the other side? That's the extreme partisanship. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I completely understand that you don't see it as in insult... That's why I asked the moderator and not you. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 
I'm 95% sure we'll pick in the top 5 this year. I don't see this crap-ass team winning another game this season.

Saying Demond instead of demon 
*Autist* *artistic-plebs* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Fucking lol. I can see that you really are an artistic intellectual. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Yes, forgive me. You are right. Positive ratings are not always an indicator of a good product. However, Kanye West has released 7 albums. All of which have received universal acclaim. SO the critics fucked up 7 times with Kanye. The whole reason I even brought up critics was because saying Kanye is good because the critics say he is is the exact same as saying he's bad because you say he is. Okay bud. You're literally trying to tell me that all the critics are just wrong, and because they say he is good, it means he bad. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  I'd also like to point out that the independent review of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, which was gave the album a 10, was written by  Andy Gill. Andy Gill is an extremely skilled guitarist who actually started the band Gang of Four. So your assertion on critics not being musicians or in the artistic community or whatever is BS.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Also about our prince quote. Quit trying to rationalizing something you don't want to hear. So prince doesn't like Kanye West but he started praising him when asked about what modern artists he likes. Come the fuck on. Nobody who hates an artist is going to randomly start praising an artist that they think is bad when asked about good modern artists. Okay? This isn't the fucking Bible, quit trying to bend quotes to fit your shitty misonformed narrative. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ So let's go over here who likes Kanye. _back_to_line_ -MANY different Critics have liked Kanye over the course of over a decade. _back_to_line_ -A musician who also started an important Metal Band was a critic who gave Kanye's album a 10. _back_to_line_ -Prince, your musical idol likes Kanye West _back_to_line_ -Paul Mccartney Likes Kanye West _back_to_line_ -Bruce Springsteen Likes Kanye West _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Who Doesn't Like Kanye West _back_to_line_ -A redditer online who never listened to a Kanye Album _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ And don't say that's a baseless assumption, you haven't. You likely couldn't even name one. If you have, please tell me the absolute shittiest thing in My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. Something you hated that you can't just google and find people talking about in a forum, because you're gonna try to do that. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 
He didn't say it was 99% faster? He said it was *faster [by some amount] in 99% of games*. That's still an overstatement, but not as drastically so. From the benches I've seen Vega really only consistently beats the 1080 in games that have well optimized Vulcan.

Killington. Always heard good things about *the beast of the east* and I went for the first time last year and was unimpressed with the large crowds, poor layout of the mountain, and ice. To be fair, it probably would have been better on a weekday.
it's not illegal to promote christmas in our country, don't believe fake news. The aforementioned anti-corruption measures are like *you can't give a Lamborghini to someone and call it a Christmas present*, or spend like a hundred grand of the company/government department's money to throw a Christmas party. Basically you can't do stuff that's basically bribery or embezzlement and justify it with religious/festive reasons. It's not a war on Christmas, we are not fucking Saudi Arabia or something
&gt;Which part is inaccurate? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ the premise, the logic, and their conclusion _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ there was never a real threat _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ any *evidence* that purports to show otherwise is generally made by the people themselves _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ for instance brianna wu sent threats to herself constantly _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ she even made a fake twitter account of her dying dog and sent mocking posts to herself *literally as her dog was dying*, trying to frame the evil nazis _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ imagine being that fucked in the head _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ none of the lolcows in the news ever got harassed, they just figured out it made more money to pretend that you had than to make shitty games and videos nobody cared about _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ the fact that their buddies in the media promoted these people under false premises is what started it in the first place _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ people were like *stop promoting talentless people just because theyre your friends* and suddenly it was *omg rape and death threats rape and death threats*
So close!

Yeah because recognizing that someone without a stable job or relationship shouldn’t be having kids makes ME the one with poor judgement. Okay.
I definitely agree. And his unit is our top PP.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ But he's shooting at 20% right now and is on a 70pt pace. I just can't see him hitting 70 while playing the tough minutes babs gives him. Not to mention Leo has been terrible this year and he's not getting moved off Naz's line. 
&gt; Then I go back to my factual point. If the number of gun deaths are what really matter, then you should be quite a bit more concerned about the nearly 8,000 black men that commit murder with guns every year then the handful of old weird white guys. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 8000 was a bullshit number, handful of old weird white guys was a bullshit statement. So if number of gun deaths are really what matter then you should be equally concerned by whites and blacks committing murder with guns every year. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ just pointing out your hypocrisy for other readers to have a giggle, dont bother replying as you are a lost cause.
I do like it and can appreciate the quality of the film making, but I don't really get the plot. Like, why are the dark army doing all this crazy shit and what did the ecorp guy have to gain from making deals with them. Also why did Wellick go along with their crazy shit, he loved it at first and said they could be gods but it's never explained why to my knowledge
I think whoever is teaching Minnesota wide receivers route running is probably the best wide receivers coach in the NFL with the emergence of him and Thielen.
Why couldn't the US just enter the fight? Political issues? Like for something with as large a scale as WWII
It's possible, but impractical.  I mostly mention because Pat doesn't even seem to be acknowledging the skill exists even though it's the best skill in the game, unless I forget an early part of the LP where he just gives up the idea of getting it.
forgot that was even an option, still it doesn't give me the same amount of familiarity that i had previously, I knew about the thargoids only enough to just basically stay still and don't provoke them when they interdict you
Don’t have to. Apparently all that is required to be a NAZI is to question the politically correct leftist narrative being shoved down our throats. You certainly don’t have to have any beliefs in common with NAZI’s to be called one in this sub. 
You can get tier 1 vapes under $250. The Arizer Solo 2 is a beast and will definitely pack a punch. A very solid improvement from the Solo, which includes a digital screen, monster battery, better and hotter heater, less draw resistance and is $240 (was much cheaper at black Friday sales) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Also the Boundless CFX is a good option too. Hits similar to the mighty, just hotter because the mighty has a cooling unit. otherwise a good option that will get you cookin', with a much larger chamber if you like to get high - though you can get spacers to make the oven smaller

I dont trust Tsumugi all that much either. The only thing I can take as fact is the TDR watermark on the outside of the cage. But that's it, everything else is speculation.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Tho, that is an interesting observation that Kokichi caught on so quickly. I wonder if when he said that he can spot a liar holds true or how well he can figure out when people lie. Or would it be more like a way a spiritual medium talks where they ask very general questions just to gauge the reaction and find some info they could hook on to, you know to prove they aren't a scam.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ That's definitely one way to put it with what Kokichi actually represented.

Okay lets look at what each coach has said recently here _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ * Dana Holgerson said he's one of the most fun and best players in the country to watch in his post game after our game _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ * Tom Herman said *that kid from Norman is also pretty good* (paraphrasing there) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ * Kliff Kingsbury as far as I'm aware hasn't said anything although we all know the history between Kingsbury and Mayfield. From what I understand from Tech fans its doubtful Kingsbury is still holding a grudge _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ * Bill Snyder has written letters to Baker Mayfield, of which he cherishes _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ * David Beaty praised his players for not shaking Mayfields hand initially although retracted the statement later (thats the most I remember Beaty handling Mayfield...may have said something else) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ * Mike Gundy said Mayfield is a fantastic player in our last meeting _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ * Matt Rhule I don't recall mentioning anything about Mayfield in our only meeting _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ * I also have not found any comments about Campbell and Mayfield. But then again Campbell beat the Sooners quite soundly in Norman _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ * Gary Patterson said he was sorry that 128 BCS schools did not offer a scholarship for Mayfield, then said that one of his players got a concussion from one of Mayfields throws while TCU was running through warm up lines (probably an intentional throw) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Deduce what you wish from this.

Isn't that just because medicare/medicaid/VA though? So we have some government run healthcare, but it's not available to a lot of people. If all the states had medicaid expansion that would be sort of a de facto public option, right? Maybe I'm mixed up on my terminology, but I've always heard single payer = only government run, multipayer = public with private option, and no public option was a private system, whether or not there are heavy subsidies.

And then when it's finally discovered that he did so, he responds by throwing himself a giant pity party (in a pastebin that can probably be best described as passive depressive), while showing seemingly no remorse that he compromised a site he viewed as the holy grail of speedrunning.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ And then ending the pastebin with *To the people I actually care about* is about as pathetic as you can get. Screw all the rest of the community that he lied to. Screw everyone that looked up to him as an amazing speedrunner and took inspiration from him. Screw everyone that worked hard to keep SDA credible and prestigious. Nope, he's only sorry to the people he personally cares about. Because he's a victim. A victim of a cruel, cruel community that just had to go out of their way to find out that he lied. And now all of his hard work is for nothing.

This is my personal opinion rudely shoving its ass through, but TV really shouldn't be a major part of a child's *culture.* Of course, Jenna plans to *facilitate* these best friendships by *creating a space* (kill me) for playdates in the basement, centered around a sub $1,000 screen. Because she'll be damned before her majesty can be bothered to set out some art supplies and peanut butter crackers. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ In my experience, more and more parents are growing increasingly disenchanted with the stream of media geared towards young kids. I know several parents of elementary aged kids who don't yet permit video games, at all. My 4 year old complained after coming home from her cousin's, because *all he wanted to do was play games on his tablet and he never wanted to build Lego with me.* Don't get me wrong, kids dig screens when they're offered. But they generally want to *play* even more. Jenna's sorry ass *Montessori* setup is laughable. That lonely, happy meal beach ball! 😂 I was half expecting a tumbleweed to meander on by.

You can equip them all with Thunder Hammers and storm shields and they will mess up some characters/vehicles.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If you are feeling like you want to waste points or are good enough to get an early charge off, you can go double wolf claws. But there’s a reason I say thunderwolves are a base 60pts a piece (actual thunder wolf and the storm shield) because they will get the absolute crap focused out of them and you’ll just watch your wolves disappear off the table.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If you want to run them in a smaller point game, the standard chain sword/bolt pistol is good. Chain sword and storm shield is decent as well.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ But personally I’ve been playing around with using Wolf claws and storm shields. Mainly because I don’t really see my Thunderwolves as vehicle killers due to their wolves 3 S5 AP-1 attacks. I figure I’d just double down on them filling my slot to kill T3/4/5 units especially since they reroll to wound (on the claws at least) thanks to the claw. Plus with S5 attacks you can at least wound on 5s to dang near everything and the AP-2 is brutal to infantry and termies alike. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Some people have tried to convince me that the frost axe is good as well and it is for things you wanna wound thanks to the S6, but my actual games that I’ve used them in have been lackluster. They both have AP-2 but the reroll to wound on the wolf claw has my vote.

&gt; This guy's problem was that he remained on his PR until his NS liability. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ That's really not the problem here. He left Singapore at the age of 18/19. I'm surprised they let him out honestly - he may have deliberately provided false information on his EP application. He was definitely liable for NS then. There is no way he would have been able to get citizenship as he would have failed the police check. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; The families with the means will just migrate and apply for citizenship before their child is liable for NS then.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ You'd think so... but [incidents](http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-born-new-zealand-teenager-has-to-fulfil-national-service-obligations-mfa) have occurred where parents haven't looked out for their children, or were simply caught unaware of their child's citizenship situation (in situations of mixed nationalities).  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Not many people are immediately aware that it is not possible to renounce your Singapore citizenship until the age of 21. As a parent you must obtain alternative citizenship for your child before the age of 11, and then defer his enlistment until 21 until which time he is allowed to renounce his citizenship. If he uses his Singaporean citizenship in any way between that time unaware, he will become liable for enlistment too, so a small slip up will easily cause issue. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_

Exactly.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ * Aldi Sud wasn't *rebranded* as Aldi. both Aldi Nord and Aldi Sud do business simply as *Aldi* in their particular regions of the world. _back_to_line_ * Trader Joe's isn't Aldi at all. It is an American-headquartered chain that happens to be owned by the same family trust that also owns Aldi Nord, making Aldi Nord and Trader Joe's sister retail chains. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ And although it isn't mentioned in this article, but it's a very frequent misconception: _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ * Trader Joe's and Aldi Sud have almost zero connection to each other. Aldi Nord and Aldi Sud will occasionally collaborate with each other to establish more favorable buying terms with vendors, but otherwise operate independently. Trader Joe's, being owned by the same trust that owns Aldi Nord, may also benefit from said buying power, meaning you *might* see a few similar items on the shelf of both Aldi Sud and Trader Joe's. However, these products would almost certainly in totally different packaging, given that most Aldi products are *house brands* that are unique to Aldi (and the same applies to Trader Joe's.)

This is why I don’t think I’ll ever have another OTP besides my current OTP. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ When I first started shipping them I hated everything about the fanfics. I thought they were wildly OOC, hated the way the two were portrayed as interacting with each other, thought the one portrayed as the seme should have been the uke and vice versa, hated the plots everyone tended to use, just everything. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ But I actually managed to write a fanfic for that pairing that got extremely popular, and now most of the popular tropes for that pairing are from my fanfic, and the seme/uke roles switched to how I had it in my fic and they’re characterized similar to how they are in my fanfic. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It’s really made me love the pairing all the more, because now everyone is basically writing them exactly how I want them to be written. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ And that’s never going to happen again! Ever! There will never be another pairing where the fanfic is so perfectly tailored to exactly what I want. And it’s been several years since I wrote that fic and there hasn’t been any new canon material for them for a long time, so the fandom continually gets smaller. Eventually no one will write that pairing anymore and I’ll NEVER love another pairing like I love that one.

Don't do pegboard. They are a neat idea but a lot less functional than they seem. You will be constantly fighting hooks falling out. French cleats, slat wall or even just a full sheet of 3/4* plywood, screws and hooks will be better.
It does, though you won't notice within 25 metres. Same goes for the Double Take, though the Kraber is unique in that is has bullet drop. You should definitely give the Double Take a shot too if you ever get tired of the Kraber (which won't happen).

Engineering sounds like the way to go for you. Your interests seem to match well for a Mechanical, Electrical, or Computer Engineering. A lot of universities have been transforming their engineering programs to where freshman year is *general engineering*. This will help you gain better perspective on your interest. You can also double major, which is common for Electrical/Computer engineering.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Sometimes people go into majors thinking this is what they really want and end up working in a completely different industry. I think asking people here about your interests is a good start. Perhaps you can ask detail questions to people with those majors, learn about what their daily jobs are like. Best of luck!!!

*Click.* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I opened the door. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ According to the other doctors, Margaret Emerson was one of the most dangerous patients in the entire facility. But I was prepared. Some orderlies were outside, in case I screamed. And there was even some mace in my pocket. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ But the woman before me was just a small, old, white-haired woman with a kind smile. *Hello, I'm Dr. Chakrabarti,* I said, extending a hand. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *Margaret,* she replied. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *How are you fee--* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *Do you remember when you first came here?* she whispered. Her breath was stale, her clothes drenched in flowery perfume, and the smile was gone. *I was there, playing bridge in the next room. You asked the head psychiatrist, Dr. Timmons, if he had a lot of experience with disruptive patients. Do you remember what he said?* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *Uh -- he laughed, and told me about some patient he once had. Dolores Johnson, I think, was her name. Said she had multiple personalities, and one was --* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *Do you think a real doctor would tell you that?* she said, drawing closer. *A doctor who swore the Hippocratic Oath, swore to uphold the privacy of his patients?* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *I guess... he made a mistake.* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ She lowered her voice to such a quiet whisper, I could barely hear it over the rain pattering outside. *Or maybe he's not an actual doctor.* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *Margaret, I don't --* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *Don't you see?!* she screamed. My grip tightened on the mace. **They* were once the patients, and *us* the doctors! Until they revolted.* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *I see,* I said. Of course, I didn't see. But I didn't want to get her excited. Or get myself killed. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It wasn't until I got back to my house that the seeds of doubt began to take root.

Wow you have no clue do you..  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The IDF in south was under constant stress from hezbollah, morale was shitty. they left in the middle of the night leaving behind tanks and ammunition. Not even their informants in south Lebanon knew.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Also you kept hundreds of prisoners from Lebanon and had been raiding and invading our air and sea even after the 2000 withdrawal.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Have you heard the phrase *fighting for peace is like fucking for virginity?*  _back_to_line_ If you want peace, do the right thing. Show the world how you are responsible, and how you can solve issue without killing thousands of innocent lives. Let's not forget the brutal destruction of Gaza in 2012. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Give the Palestinians their fair rights, stop massacring civilians and beating women and children.  Build schools hospitals and bridges, not walls! Provide the basic rights that you took away from them such as electricity, clean water, proper economic prosperity.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Stop flying your jets over Lebanon or intruding with your ships into our sea to harass local fishermen. If you help eradicate illiteracy and poverty, people will no longer be so desperate as to refer to shady measures to fight off the oppressor. Hizbollah came out of desperation with the way the IDF was treating civilians in the south of Lebanon. Stealing water, destroying crops, occupying...  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The internet is full of Israeli violations and atrocities, you never once tried behaving like a the true civilized country you claim you are. You only behave like a nazi oppressor, a terrorist state wearing and tuxedo.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Seriously, stop lying to yourself and look at how much trouble you've created in the region. Is it true that you are 100% guilt free of all of it?  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The truth is, you don't want peace, you want to oppress, you are racists, and you will suffer the consequences.  _back_to_line_ Your government knows it can keep its neighbors busy with war and will keep doing so. You don't want hizbollah gone, you want to have an excuse to invade again in the future. You make statements like *we will return Lebanon to the stone age*. If your problem is with hizbollah why do you take it out on civilians?  You see, this is what keeps hizbollah around and forces us to support them; your warmongering terrorist mentality.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Really man, stop lying to yourself.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Ps: if you want more proof that you don't want peace, i can keep going all day long. Afterall im a christian from Lebanon and i see beyond your bullshit. My ideology is based on personal experience not politics or emotion. So go find some illiterate hizbollah supporter to argue with 'cause that would be more of your level of ignorance. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_

Why?  This is more of a philosophical issue.  You as a player have no choice over the levels of your cards, it's total RNG.  The number of unique loadouts you as a player can make is just from the cards you choose, you don't have agency over their values.  If you want the total number anyways, just multiply the value given by 5^6. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ edit: legendaries have levels too because... :vomit:

&gt;The question remains just how reliable these sources are and how sound their evidence is. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ When your source is ecowatch then the source is objectively bad. And in this case, so is the evidence. You realize this was just something a lawyer suing Monsanto alleged in court right? They presented no evidence to prove it. Ecowatch doesn't want you to know that though, they would rather pander to their anti-science audience. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;It's also obvious that the numbers defending Monsanto so consistently any and everywhere it's mentioned are not likely the result of pure chance. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ How did you calculate these odds? What statistical analysis did you use to determine that? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;It would be nice to see a good unbiased investigative journalist dig into these claims. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Then why did you source Ecowatch? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Edit: So considering your source doesn't provide any real evidence, I reiterate my original three questions: _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ How do you know Monsanto hires hordes of shills? How do you know they are on reddit? And how do you know this article was part of Monsanto's PR campaign? _back_to_line_

The base price is about $60 and it has a five star average on Newegg (albeit only like fifteen reviews) so I thought it wasn't bottom of the barrel. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; But you care about rendering times right? Then you should overclock. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Fair enough, glad to hear that about the mobo. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Thanks for the insight!
Mili base is often camped, especially during south games. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I think you're trying to say that camping is only valid inside late-ish circles where it's likely you'll be in it for a while. The ship would almost certainly never be inside circle. However, I think they should hardcode it not to count as valid circle centre location so that final circle isn't on it lol. Then again that could be interesting.
i disagree with both of you
She's acting crazy, but I think you handled it defensively when you should have just been like *oh yeah I'll try, sorry!* And then not worried about it.  I feel like you escalated the situation when you could have just placated her and ignored her request.  The car thing was a nice thing your husband did, and most people would have done the same. The vacuum thing is a weird request, worthy of ignoring and just being on the lookout for similar behavior.  I think you escalated it too soon. Sometimes it is just easier to say sorry and internally roll your eyes at people, rather than starting a big drama. 
She's a 12 year reality show veteran who intends to stay on the show because it's an easy paycheck. She's going to say what she needs to say to get another season. Both Tamra and Shannon knew this but their hands were tied. They will have to film with her next season.

I guess my point is this. The sole purpose of language is to convey information. Nowadays labels have a problem doing this because of the amount of misuse.  Your internal definition for words is irrelevant. It only matters how the individuals you’re speaking to take it.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If it’s something important, a label may, or may not be the best course. Just try to convey what you wish to communicate in the easiest way possible.  (I’m pretty bad at this, that’s why I over explain and never shut up)       ;)
Oh no does it affect existinf users as well?
Actually, Defense Penetration is how much of the enemy's Defense stat (which makes you receive less damage) you can ignore.

I'm looking to buy a set of JBL 305 speakers, however, I'm not really experienced with anything regarding audio. Ideally, I'd like to be able to connect to the speakers wirelessly with my phone, so I'm wondering what sort of DAC I should be looking at. Also, I'm unsure what cables I would need to buy.

Cable mod works well enough. It's not perfect but still better than any solid state amp I've ever played. Combined with pedals I love my bedroom level tone.

That has no relevance to why those players prefer Reboot servers over normal servers. The main appeal is that P2W is legitimised in the normal servers through certain cash shop items but not in the Reboot servers. Sure, you can't check every player in another guild but surely, if someone in your own guild is progressing a little *too* quickly, you know something is up.

But if you don't want to pay aniplex prices then get a region free player and buy the [UK version for £14 + shipping, which is super cheap IIRC](https://www.zavvi.com/blu-ray/gurren-lagann-the-complete-collection/10891995.html). I mean, I don't even think the show is all that great and I couldn't resist at that price.

I have a similar concern. What I've been doing is making eye contact about 50ft away just to acknowledge I see the person, then making eye contact again and adding a nod and a smile if I we're acquainted. It's less creepy than holding the eye contact and lets the other person feel seen instead of ignored. 
Seriously, what's wrong with the vase? I don't see anything wrong.

I agree, though I do think that the OP is still relevant. My own experience in the activist community has seen the development of an almost academic exercise in finding new things that certain people aren't allowed to say or do or wear or eat, with any questioning of the value of the process being met with shaming. There is a certain ideological structure that is assumed to be a basic test of morality, and it severely limits the opportunity for discussion in the very communities where people are supposed to be the most engaged. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Frankly, I spent years assuming that this was simply a tumblr stereotype propagated by the right. Then I watched these attitudes actually take over my own groups until I simply stopped being involved. It's really sad seeing the few people who aren't apathetic turning ideas and perspectives into purity tests.
Thanks so much! And getting to know her is the only real problem. I'm in the AP program so I am kind of segregated from the rest of the school, as my lunch block and free block are only for other kids in the specific program.

I've never asked a girl out before and I really would be heartbroken if it turned out she's not queer. 
Whenever they say *MUH 1%* they are doing their best to ignore the fact that if your household makes at least $130k (duel income household that is easily obtainable for an average middle class family) you pay for 70% of our government. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Literally only need to have you and your partner make about 65k each to be in the group that provides for 70% of our government and they have the audacity to say *pay your fair share*. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ #BUT MUH 1%!
That negates a QBs ability to extend plays, allowing their receivers either A) have more time to separate or B) sit in a pocket between defenders. It also negates plays designed for QBs to throw to pockets where WRs will be versus timed routes

Relative pitch is very trainable, perfect pitch however, is not (are you certain you're not confusing the two?).   _back_to_line_ when people talk of having *a good ear* or *ear training*, the *ear* is relative pitch. when relating this to an instrument, it is basically how fluent a person is in expressing a musical idea on that instrument. This is a trained skill, which you must have picked up very quickly (young child + good brain i'd wager), but still something you learned, and got better at with time, as all musicians do.

I would think that obsidian skin owners should get the unique gun skin that came with the purchase unlocked for account wide use.
It may seem a pain to some to reach across the table for your pieces, but I actually love that the motherships orbit the *sun* (/board). That mechanic very thematically forces a tense cooperation in an otherwise really cutthroat game. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &amp;nbsp; _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ EVERY decision feels significant. Every little thing you do. In order to build you have to telegraph the prerequisite *movement* to make an energy node (for example). So you can watch an opponent get into position and ready your own ships nearby to activate it. But he needs to spend a turn to build it, will he build if he sees you ready and waiting? How long do YOU wait? Meanwhile, which layer of the sun should you build on? It's advantageous to make stations on different layers, but is it worth it to spend a turn moving all your ships deeper for that bonus? Can you fly over to your opponent's foundry in time to activate it before he can gather the energy to pay for the bonus he'll get from your activation? If so, you'll claim the bonus. If not, is that move still worth it? And don't forget, you can control the length of a game by being hyperactive near the core where you'll make the star unstable faster, vs. playing it safe on the edges for a longer-term strategy. It can be a huge advantage to use the instability (aka game timer) to your advantage like that. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &amp;nbsp; _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I'm by no means an expert on this game. I don't win every time I play. And, cards on the table-- a big reason I love it so much is the really high production value (I'm a superficial board gamer, and from pieces to iconography, **Sol** is seriously beautiful). But once you start to understand the gameplay (which doesn't take long with this one-action-per-turn game), it becomes quick and dynamic and a really cool puzzle.
Anyone stop to think these might be part of an ongoing investigation now and releasing them would compromise that investigation?

Dragonball defenses seem to be based entirely on the defender being consciously aware of the attack to protect against it. Otherwise, one of the most repeated lines in the current arc wouldn't be the sidelines constantly shouting at the fighters to remind them not to let their guard down. Goku's arm was able to be bruised by an assault rifle after he had stopped training for a few weeks before the Tournament of Power arc because he wasn't exactly trying to defend seriously. And during his fight against Golden Frieza in Resurrection of F, he was able to be KO'd by a handheld beam pistol (that we have no evidence to suggest it's beam as being different from naturally generated ki blasts) because he wasn't paying attention to Frieza's henchman behind him.

The cat comment was obviously a lil' joke, and the rest is just chatter.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ But I do think it's only human beings who actively, purposefully, with malice, be evil for the fun of it. Although I recall an article about dolphins that studied they torture for fun. Ah, never mind. You're right. Bloody dolphins.
1) World Souls - Basically, some planets are like unborn Titan incubators.  It's extremely rare, most planets don't have a world soul.  And they take a really, really, really, *really* long time to mature.  But once they do, they become a proper, adult, uber-powerful Titan.  We learned about it through Magni, who managed to successfully commune with Azeroth herself when he turned to diamond back in Cata.  He just woke up with the start of Legion. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 2) They're the big, bad daddies of the Old Gods.  Literally the most powerful and evil threat to our universe imaginable.  Fortunately, they exist sort of outside our reality, and can't manifest themselves in it except for the briefest of instants.  What they want to do is corrupt a Titan, and use it to consume all the matter in the universe, because that essentially feeds them.  However, adult (born) titans are immune to their attempts at corruption.  However, unborn titans, also known as world-souls are not.  So their goal is to corrupt a world-soul and have it be born as a spooky scary void Titan, and if that happens, they win, and it's game over for us.  There's no way of knowing which planets have world-souls, and they're really really, *really* rare, so all the Void Lords could do is fling a bunch of Old Gods randomly through space, hoping that they'll land on a planet with a world-soul.  Old Gods are space parasites, basically.  There are plenty of planets scattered throughout the universe that they've corrupted, but (as far as we know) only one planet with Old Gods has a world-soul: ours.  Azeroth.  We better pray that they don't finish corrupting her before she's born, or we're all fucked.  And at this point, things don't look good.  We learned about Void lords through the Chronicle book.  I'm not sure any in-game characters know about them at this point except for Sargeras &amp; the Pantheon.  Well, and the Old Gods, I suppose. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 2.5) All this stuff ties closely in with the Burning Legion.  Basically, way back when, Sargeras found out about the Void Lords &amp; what they're up to.  He didn't want to run the risk of them corrupting all the life in the universe, particularly the world-souls, so his plan was to destroy that life, and kill all those world-souls before the Void Lords could get to them.  A scorched-earth way of saving the universe.  The rest of the Pantheon disagreed.  They wanted to protect life, especially that of their unborn brethren, and instead tried to just cleanse the corruption wherever they encountered it.  Sargeras didn't think this would work, so they had a falling-out.  A violent falling-out, that led to him slaughtering the rest of the Pantheon.  Then, he got himself an army of demons and set out on a Crusade to save the universe by burning it all down. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 3) Illidan stayed behind to make sure that Sargeras would stay imprisoned.  Basically, the last remnants of the essences of the Pantheon used their remaining power + the power remaining in Argus to lock up Sargeras, presumably in a smaller, Avatar-sized body that will sit in once of those seats and keep him contained.  Illidan is gonna stick around and make sure it stays that way. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 3.5)  The overarching story of Legion?  The Burning Legion returns, and we manage to defeat them permanently.  In more detail, AU-Gul'dan gets to Azeroth, goes to the Tomb of Sargeras, and opens up a portal, from which a new Legion invasion spills forth.  We go and try to stop it and get our asses kicked a bunch.  Also, Gul'dan stole Illidan, but we steal him back.  _back_to_line_  Now he's helping us.  Eventually we kill Gul'dan, and then try to seal the tomb-portal.  We run into Kil'jaden and fight him on his spaceship.  We finally kill him, but he took his  ship (and all of us in the raid group + Velen, Khadgar, and Illidan) to Argus, the Burning Legion homeworld.  Looks like we're stuck here, fuck.  Oh wait, Illidan had the Sargerite Keystone, the super-important super-powerful Legion portal-opening thingy.  He opens up a portal between Argus and Azeroth so we can get back home.  Except oh wait, he left it open, so now Argus is sitting right next to Azeroth.  Everyone panics cause the home base of the Legion is *right there in the sky* but Illidan is like now it's time to take the fight to them so we can end this shit.  Velen &amp; friends get on the spaceship they've been building from the Exodar's parts, and fly on over to Argus, where they meet up with another Spaceship that more draeni &amp; Turalyon and Alleria were on.  We start fucking shit up on Argus, and discover that Sargeras was attempting to take the remaining spirits of the Titan Pantheon he slew, and stick them into new bodies under his command, so he'll have some really absurdly powerful additions to his army.  He already did so with Aggramar.  We go to his home base to stop this shit before it's too late.  We succeed, although he also awakened Argus, which had a world-soul, so we've gotta beat this new baby titan as well.  Sargeras tries to give Azeroth a giant hug (which would presumably bring our planet &amp; world-soul under his control, and be very bad), but what remains of the Pantheon manages to stop him before he can do so.  Unfortunately, he stabs our planet in his final moments, so now that doesn't look too good.  Looking towards the future, we gotta find a way to heal Azeroth so she doesn't die or something (cause she just got stabbed), and also hope that the Old Gods don't fuck her up too much before she's born.  It's looking really dire at this point. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 3.5.5)  Legion's story in a TL;DR:  The Legion invades us again, but then we invade them, and defeat them for the final time. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 3.5.10) Side stories from Legion: Varian and Vol'jin died at the broken shore.  Anduin and Sylvannas lead the Alliance &amp; Horde now.  The Alliance and Horde are back to hating each other again, and they also give up on the whole fighting the Legion thing.  That's why the class orders form, and they're the ones that take the fight to the Legion (along with Illidan, Khadgar, &amp; Velen primarily).  We meet yet another type of Tauren, and help them reunite all their tribes.  There's been an old, uncorrupted black dragon hanging out with them this whole time, so that's pretty cool.  We also meet yet another type of Elves, who have yet another type of magic well, and we help them out with a rebellion.  Sylvannas nearly manages to enslave the biggest, baddest Val'kyr, but Greymane stops her.  We finally meet Odyn, who left Uludar way back when, and we kill Helya, who had been keeping him locked up.  But Odyn's kind of a dick and never really did anything anyway so nobody cares and it doesn't matter.  The Emerald Nightmare got a hell of a lot worse.  Cenarius got corrupted and almost died.  Ysera got corrupted and then did die, and that's sad.  But we finally kill Xavius, who started the Nightmare in the first place, and end this threat for good.  Azshara also waves hello, and some of her minions come say hi to us, but we haven't really dealt with her yet.
Lol, lets hate the people smoking weed, sitting in their basement not bothering anyone while the NFL and the rest of America glorifies a drug that kills more people every year than all the others.

Even if you roll poorly, you still had first dibs regarding the outcome, and that is going to make other players mad or envious. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Your best bet is just to let some encounters enfold without your interference and let other party members be the first to shape their result.

Hillary couldn't really challenge him on those assertions either, because she was so battered down by propaganda at that point that she couldn't risk appearing *aggressive* or *bitchy* by challenging him, and instead went with the *let the fucking moron talk himself to death* strategy.

Not a joke. Fortune cookies were invented by Chinese people living in America. They don't have them in China. Most Chinese will have no idea what they are. You will have to explain that this is a very Chinese thing that exists outside China, give them some background info. Also a good idea to demonstrate how it works, that there is a paper inside, and that you can eat the cookie. They are a hit, especially with girls.

&gt; The result of Uranium 1 deal is that now NK and Iran have Uranium to use for whatever purposes they want. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ No it's not. Uranium isn't uncommon. All of North Korea's uranium is mined in country. They don't have to import uranium.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;North Korea possesses uranium mines containing an estimated 4 million tons of high-grade uranium ore.[128] _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction#Highly_enriched_uranium_program _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The bottle neck isn't the uranium supply, it's the enrichment facilities. Iran and NK have hundreds of tons of uranium. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; Morell told PunditFact he said 5,000 because that was lowest number he had heard was in play. The number of centrifuges in place today is a hair over 20,000, and a likely goal is to cut that to about 5,000. But Morell’s basic point struck us as just plain intriguing. We wanted to learn more about this idea that a nuclear power program would require many more centrifuges than you’d need for a bomb -- which by extension means that limiting centrifuge capacity is just one negotiating point out of many. _back_to_line_ &gt;  _back_to_line_ &gt; The consensus among the experts we reached is that Morell is on the money. Matthew Kroenig at Georgetown University told PunditFact the Morell is *is absolutely correct.*  Ditto for Daryl Kimball of the Arms Control Association and David Albright of the Institute for Science and International Security. _back_to_line_ &gt;  _back_to_line_ &gt; Matthew Bunn at Harvard agreed with his colleagues. _back_to_line_ &gt;  _back_to_line_ &gt; *People think surely you must need a bigger enrichment system to make 90 percent enriched material for bombs than to make 4-5 percent enriched material for power reactors,* Bunn said. *But exactly the opposite is true.* _back_to_line_ &gt;  _back_to_line_ &gt; Bunn said there are two reasons. First, you need tens of tons of material to fuel a power reactor for a year, but just **tens of kilograms to make a bomb.** According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the threshold amount for a bomb is about 25 kilograms of the most highly enriched U-235. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/feb/25/michael-morell/odd-reality-irans-centrifuges-enough-bomb-not-powe/ _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; Ali Akbar Salehi was quoted by the semi-official Fars news agency on Sunday as saying that Iran would receive a final batch of 149 tons of natural uranium by Tuesday, in addition to 210 tons already delivered since early 2016. _back_to_line_ &gt;  _back_to_line_ &gt; The huge shipment of natural uranium from Russia was to compensate it for exporting tons of reactor coolant, diplomats said earlier this month, in a move approved by the outgoing US administration and other governments seeking to keep Tehran committed to a landmark nuclear pact. _back_to_line_ &gt;  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ https://www.timesofisrael.com/iran-uranium-shipment-will-give-us-60-more-than-pre-deal/ _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;Sum of all Fears refers to US Uranium getting in the hands of foreign bad actors to make a dirty bomb to attack the USA. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ [Does Russia Really Own 20% Of The US' Uranium Reserves?](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-05-07/does-russia-really-own-20-us-uranium-reserves) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The crown jewel of the Uranium One deal was getting control of Kazakhstan's uranium production, not the United States'. Remedial levels of research reveals such claims to be fraudulent. The idea that Obama has vested uranium business interests or is personally involved in gun running is fictitious. The shadow arms trade operates at an institutional level. It's not something an upstart politician put on an escalator to power would be personally operating.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Obama ticked off the right ideological and demographic tick boxes and Ted Kennedy saw an opening for a malleable, unseasoned politician to be carried to the highest thrown of power. Ted thrust him to the forefront of the Democratic party and the political machine took care of the rest. He had enough brains to be a competent executive, but some Machiavellian ring master he was not. He was overwhelmingly a third and fourth term Bush presidency in a liberal cloaking, unquestionably so when it came to foreign policy. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ There's much easier and less dangerous ways to fund his presidential library, not least of which are the kickbacks he's owed for shielding the financial sector from any repercussions for instigating the 2008 financial collapse. If you want to see what political deviance in the pursuit of personal enrichment looks like then simply study the history of the Clintons. They're the inside money handlers buffered by layers of cut-outs upon cut-outs and insulated with the thinnest veneers of legality. They give their operations just enough credibility to dupe the credulous public.

Seriously, he's a guy who made some great decisions and made fantastic games, 1 of which I'd consider to be the best in the series not only for it's spectacular gameplay, but also for it's shockingly uplifting message and themes. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ That being said, every game has it's problems, and the Kaga era games all have the longest list of problems in the series, but they also have the highest quality on the list of upsides. Stuff like: actually Player Phase centric gameplay, therefore allowing archers and snipers to be actually useful, fatigue, a mechanic that discourages juggernauting in a huge way, rescuing, capturing, supports, gaiden maps, Fog of War, mutually exclusive characters (that's a big one for me, it allows different playthroughs to be different in more ways than just what units you train), almost all of the objectives used in the games today (I think arrive is the only one he didn't come up with, and that's basically Seize but anyone can do it), etc.

&gt; Why do you think the republicans are still pushing for it? What motivates them? I don't see their constituencies particularly liking it, perhaps I'm wrong though. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I think that /u/recruit00 summarized it pretty well. Congressional Republicans are aching for a legislative victory, and their attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act--which has been the party's hill to die on for the last seven years--have thus far failed. It's at the point where Congressional party members are actively denying reality in their efforts to achieve such a victory, claiming that repeal of the ACA would actually expand health coverage, stating that hiking taxes and removing deductions for the middle and lower classes while cutting them for the upper class will actually save money for the middle and lower classes and somehow still raise revenue, claiming *fiscal responsibility* even though this is massively fiscally irresponsible. Long story short, it's all a drawn-out partisan political game as a reaction to the handful of successes enjoyed by the Obama administration.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;Furthermore, do you think republicans say, 5 years ago, when Romney was the nominee would have supported this tax bill? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Possibly, but I doubt it. The party at that point hadn't fallen into the hands of radicals (i.e. Trumpists), so some version of the current bill might have been pushed by party leaders (especially with tax cuts being a central tenet of the Republican Party's ideology for the past few decades), but I doubt that it would be nearly as severe as the current plan.

(Plus the stupid parties that nobody cares about) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ And finally, 90% of his streams recently have been those trash-tier *chill* streams where nothing happens. _back_to_line_ I kind of already said this, but we've had NO focused streams recently.

To me the card that doesn't really make sense is lakkaki felhound. You are rarely going to combo with Imp and The deck has less low cost cards than an average Zoo. Sure it can combo with krull but the downside seems to be too big. Also to improve the late game curve i think Lich King might be very powerful.

The previous sanctions on Iran were unravelling because only the West was strictly abiding by them. It's a large reason why Obama decided to move towards a deal or it would risk the scenario where Europe and the USA would be the last to gain business opportunity in Iran, lost to countries China, Russia, Turkey and India. Obama took the risk to negotiate a deal, have western business return to Iran and hope Iran and the USA could settle down its dispute over regional influence over the next 10 years. The nuclear deal was supposed to be the beginning of a new approach to deal with Iran as the USA was losing a fight for regional influence. Trump has ruined this of course, with a return to hostile rhetoric and wanting to sanction Iran again. Except this time it will only be US sanctions and the rest of the world will do business with Iran. It took a lot of diplomacy by Obama to sanction Iran as it was between 2009-2015. Something that Netenyahu and Trump can't do. They don't know how to deal with Iran other than repeat rhetoric from the bush era about WMD's etc that nobody believes anymore.

I'm also curious about people's hobbies! I am not currently working a blue collar job, but in the past it was automotive. I have many non tradesy hobbies but have a few that are. I restore old machines. A few of mechanical typewriters, so far. I have started my first electrical restoration, a telephone from the 30s-40s. I got it working but wires are breaking, so I want to replace them all. i think it's a perfect project for someone beginning in electric! I am also very curious about woodworking but am trying to get my busy husband to share that hobby with me.
Interesting. A couple of years ago there was a study that claimed that covering NYC's available wallspace with solar cells could provide 40% of the cities needs. Later on Perovskites dual layer cells raised that to 80%. Now windows add another 80%.  Haven't got 'round to wind, offshore or on.

Ok so in doing this based on my 52K salary. $3000 a month a take home. Let's say his tax rate doesn't go up by doubling that salary (unlikely) and we're at $6,000 a month. 3 goes to rent. We're at 3,000 left. Car payment +insurance is say $400. Food and alcohol is $1,600. He's now down to $1,000 a month to pay for entertainment, basic life expenses, utilities etc... _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I can easily see a low six figure salary being pay check to pay check in that area.
An atheist was walking through the colorful Spring woods admiring the beauty of Mother Nature and thinking about how ridiculous it was that some magical being in the sky could have made all of it.

Please save me!!* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Time froze. The colorful forest faded to greys. The bear was motionless. A great booming voice called down from the heavens: *All of your life, you have walked the Earth denying my existence. And now, in your time of need, you would ask me to spare you? Would you now claim to be a Christian?* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The atheist replied: *You are right. That would be wrong of me to ask for this. I am not a Christian, and it would be hypocritical for me to want this now.

Time began moving again. The bear, previously frozen in mid-charge, began moving again, but slowed its charge. Just before it reached the atheist, it lowered itself to one knee and said, *Dear Lord. Thank you for this food for which I am about to receive....*

Both amazing albums! Dance Gavin Dance has to be one of my favorite bands ever! Their albums are all so different to me, so it's hard to pick a favorite, but Acceptance Speech has a soft spot in my heart for introducing them to me. What really sold me one them, though, was Happiness. If you like Instant Gratification, you might like this one, since it has a funk/pop feel to it, with just a smidge of psychedelia. I highly suggest it if you haven't checked it out already!

My hair stays smooth, glossy and holds its style for days and days when I use it before a blow out. A+   _back_to_line_ * **CLINIQUE Cheek Pops- Pansy and Cola Pop**- I love them both. Pansy Pop looks amazingly natural and fresh on me. It has become my go to for minimal makeup days. I do find I have to build  it up quite a bit to get a good colour pay off though. I am hoping this is one of those products that initially has a bit of hard pan on top, and that it will get a bit softer and require less building. Cola pop on the other hand needs a careful hand on me right out of the gate, but is highly blendable and diffuses nicely without disturbing my layers underneath. I love it.   _back_to_line_ * **Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Hydra-Gel Eye Patches**- these are fantastic. Intensely hydrating, stay put, plump up fine lines like nobody’s business, and cooling without being irritating. I think I need to try the Cloud Cream next, but a very long time from now…after I have used up all the things I already have here.   _back_to_line_ * **Nars soft matte concealer**- I love MAC prolongwear, but I don’t always like faffing around with the little pump bottle. I like this for the convenience of the little jar, and how it melds nicely with the skin when applied with fingers.

Brun and Concrete complete the run of neutral taupe/brown mattes in my cool palette (omega &gt;coquette &gt; concrete &gt;Brun).

Yes, follow this advice. Providers are used to receiving stupid emails full of spelling/grammar mistakes by people who clearly have not read the information on their website. If you speak in clear, polite, and full sentences with proper grammar and offer up whatever information she requests, more often than not she will see you without references.

As he said, scorch. It is very common for scorch to be a deciding factor in a game. If there is a competitively viable card that randomly draws a special silver, I'm confident that scorch vs not scorch will be a deciding factor in many games. Obviously it wouldn't win the game *consistently* otherwise you would just play it raw. The inconsistency is precisely the problem.

I would switch to a soil mixture that has as little organic material, like wood, as possible. You want fast-draining soil, so you could mix in 1 part perlite with 1 part cactus and succulent soil. 
Not believing in a deity is kind of the default though. These days, most people probably wouldn‘t spontaneously start believing in god if the concept wasn‘t so well established and subscribed to already. „Forcing atheism“ on anyone doesn‘t really make any sense.

Breathe. Men and women both tend to struggle when realizing they have a sub side. Women wonder how they can be feminists while craving to submit to a man. Men wonder how they can be strong/macho/The Provider when they want to curl up and obey women. (Speaking strictly from a hetro standpoint of course). _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Online a lot of men use the sub label but just want the leather-clad lady to do things to them with no care of what she needs/wants. That's common in most femdom porn. That can happen as a Top/bottom scenario; though by itself it's not really D/s. Dommes don't like it much either.  So a lot of dominant women don't present themselves as such right from the get-go until they trust a guy. How do you get trusted and find people who are kinky? Look for your local community.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If you want to get out into the local community join Fetlife (kink Facebook not a dating site) and look for munches nearby.

Hi!  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It looks like you are talking about the book *Guns, Germs, and Steel* by *Jared Diamond*. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The book over the past years has become rather popular, which is hardly surprising since it is a good and entertaining read. It has reached the point that for some people it has sort of reached the status of gospel. On /r/history we noticed a trend where every time a question was asked that has even the slightest relation to the book a dozen or so people would jump in and recommending the book.  Which in the context of history is a bit problematic and the reason this reply has been written.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Why it is problematic can be broken down into two reasons:  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 1. In academic history there isn't such thing as one definitive authority or work on things, there are often others who research the same subjects and people that dive into work of others to build on it or to see if it indeed holds up. This being critical of your sources and not relying on one source is actually a very important history skill often lacking when dozens of people just spam the same work over and over again as a definite guide and answer to *everything*.   _back_to_line_ 2. There are a good amount modern historians and anthropologists that are quite critical of *Guns, Germs, and Steel* and there are some very real issues with Diamond's work. These issues are often overlooked or not noticed by the people reading his book. Which is understandable given the fact that for many it will be their first exposure to the subject. Considering the popularity of the book it is also the reason that we felt it was needed to create this response.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ In an ideal world, every time the book was posted in /r/history, it would be accompanied by critical notes and other works covering the same subject. Lacking that a dozen other people would quickly respond and do the same. But simply put, that isn't always going to happen and as a result, we have created this response so people can be made aware of these things. Does this mean that the /r/history mods hate the book or Diamond himself? No, if that was the case we would simply instruct the bot to remove every mention of it, this is just an attempt to bring some balance to a conversation that in popular history had become a bit unbalanced. _back_to_line_ It should also be noted that being critical of someone's work isn't that same as outright dismissing it. Historians are always critical of any work they examine, that is part of they core skill set and key in doing good research.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Below you'll find a list of other works covering much of the same subject, further below you'll find an explanation of why many historians and anthropologists are critical of Diamonds work.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ ## Other works covering the same and similar subjects.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ - [*Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/174710.Seven_Myths_of_the_Spanish_Conquest) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ - [*1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39020.1491) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ - [*Last Days of the Inca*](https://www.amazon.com/Last-Days-Incas-Kim-MacQuarrie/dp/0743260503/) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ - [*Epidemics and Enslavement: Biological Catastrophe in the Native Southeast, 1492-1715*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/354038.The_Last_Days_of_the_Incas) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ - [*The Great Divergence*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199002.The_Great_Divergence) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ - [*Why the West Rules for Now*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9491855-why-the-west-rules-for-now) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ - [*Ecological Imperialism: The Biological Expansion of Europe, 900-1900*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/983034.Ecological_Imperialism) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ ## Criticism on *Guns, Germs, and Steel* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Many historians and anthropologists believe Diamond plays fast and loose with history by generalizing highly complex topics to provide an ecological/geographical determinist view of human history. There is a reason historians avoid grand theories of human history: those [*just so stories*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-so_story) don't adequately explain human history. It's true however that it is an entertaining introductory text that forces people to look at world history from a different vantage point. That being said, Diamond writes a rather oversimplified narrative that seemingly ignores the human element of history. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ **Cherry-picked data while ignoring the complexity of issues**   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ In his chapter *Lethal Gift of Livestock* on the origin of human crowd infections he picks 5 pathogens that best support his idea of domestic origins. However, when diving into the genetic and historic data, only two pathogens (maybe influenza and most likely measles) could possibly have jumped to humans through domestication. The majority were already a part of the human disease load before the origin of agriculture, domestication, and sedentary population centers.  _back_to_line_ This is an example of Diamond ignoring the evidence that didn't support his theory to explain conquest via disease spread to immunologically naive Native Americas.  _back_to_line_    _back_to_line_ A similar case of cherry-picking history is seen when discussing the conquest of the Inca. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; Pizarro's military advantages lay in the Spaniards' steel swords and other weapons, steel armor, guns, and horses... Such imbalances of equipment were decisive in innumerable other confrontations of Europeans with Native Americans and other peoples. The sole Native Americans able to resist European conquest for many centuries were those tribes that reduced the military disparity by acquiring and mastering both guns and horses. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ This is a very broad generalization that effectively makes it false. Conquest was not a simple matter of conquering a people, raising a Spanish flag, and calling *game over.* Conquest was a constant process of negotiation, accommodation, and rebellion played out through the ebbs and flows of power over the course of centuries. Some Yucatan Maya city-states maintained independence for two hundred years after contact, were *conquered*, and then immediately rebelled again.  _back_to_line_ The Pueblos along the Rio Grande revolted in 1680, dislodged the Spanish for a decade, and instigated unrest that threatened the survival of the entire northern edge of the empire for decades to come.  _back_to_line_ Technological *advantage*, in this case guns and steel, did not automatically equate to battlefield success in the face of resistance, rough terrain and vastly superior numbers. The story was far more nuanced, and conquest was never a cut and dry issue, which in the book is not really touched upon. In the book it seems to be case of the Inka being conquered when Pizarro says they were conquered. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ **Uncritical examining of the historical record surrounding conquest**   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Being critical of the sources you come across and being aware of their context, biases and agendas is a core skill of any historian.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Pizarro, Cortez and other conquistadores were biased authors who wrote for the sole purpose of supporting/justifying their claim on the territory, riches and peoples they subdued. To do so they elaborated their own sufferings, bravery, and outstanding deeds, while minimizing the work of native allies, pure dumb luck, and good timing. If you only read their accounts you walk away thinking a handful of adventurers conquered an empire thanks to guns and steel and a smattering of germs. No historian in the last half century would be so naive to argue this generalized view of conquest, but European technological supremacy is one keystone to Diamond's thesis so he presents conquest at the hands of a handful of adventurers. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ **The construction of the arguments for GG&amp;S paints Native Americans specifically, and the colonized world in general, as categorically inferior**.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ To believe the narrative you need to view Native Americans as fundamentally naive, unable to understand Spanish motivations and desires, unable react to new weapons/military tactics, unwilling to accommodate to a changing political landscape, incapable of mounting resistance once conquered, too stupid to invent the key technological advances used against them, and doomed to die because they failed to build cities, domesticate animals and thereby acquire infectious organisms. When viewed through this lens, we hope you can see why so many historians and anthropologists are livid that a popular writer is perpetuating a false interpretation of history while minimizing the agency of entire continents full of people. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ ### Further reading.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If you are interested in reading more about what others think of Diamon's book you can give these resources a go:  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ - [/r/askHistorians section in their FAQ about GG&amp;S](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/historians_views#wiki_historians.27_views_of_jared_diamond.27s_.22guns.2C_germs.2C_and_steel.22) _back_to_line_ - [Jim Blaut on Jared Diamond](http://louisproyect.wordpress.com/2009/04/24/jim-blaut-on-jared-diamond/)  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Take a look at the Adventist Health Study. It specifically controls for factors like general health, smoking, exercise, etc. Even after you control for those factors, vegetarians do far better than meat eaters and vegans do even better still-- this is not only with regards to heart disease, but also several forms of cancer and general mortality. This study has a sample size of over 20,000 and has been going on for awhile now so the data is quite good. There are also other similar studies like this, as well as a few studies where they have meat eaters take on a vegan diet, which allows us to track their improvements vs the control group; that evidence also suggests that a plant based diet is healthier. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ B12 isn't found in plants, but it is added to animal diets to make meat have extra B12, so it isn't as if meat eaters aren't supplementing B12-- they just get it indirectly. You can get vitamin D from sunlight, but as far as I'm aware there isn't a significant difference between vegan and non-vegan vitamin D levels. You can easily get plant-based vitamin D supplements too. Cashews and seaseme seeds have more zinc per calorie than meat. Tofu and black beans have more iron per calorie than red meat. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If you are interested in the health benefits of a plant based diet, *Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death* is a great video to watch.

No, that's actually more possible due to Star providing ZERO context cues that she knew it was the day before her birthday. She makes no note of it, doesn't have any presents, ignores Marco, and treats the SoulRise the big event that happens at midnight. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ There are no context cues that she remembered. Your only way to think she remembered is that Star is friends with him and would take the time to remember this. Take note of a comment I wrote in the thread that I want Marco to actually say she remembered.

Probably not, considering those are fake. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ You're talking about the rumour that he dated a 14 year old, right? That age comes from a role playing journal that someone mistook for his ex-girlfriend's real journal. They saw the birthday listed as 1990 on the livejournal and thought she was 14 when they dated (they started dating in Dec. 2004). She wasn't - she was arrested a few years ago and her birthdate is on the arrest record. She was born in July 1987. Still kind of a creepy age difference, but legal.

It will be good to get ideas what you like / dislike, but I wouldn't pull the trigger yet: _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Your dress should match the overall *vibe* of the wedding: you might feel 'misplaced' if you got a ball gown and later decided to get married in a barn, and you might feel 'underdressed' if you buy a simple dress and later choose a ball room or grand hotel as your venue. If you get married in the winter, you might want a long-sleeved dress rather than a tea-length strapless one. This is why people suggest you have a 'rough idea' (i.e. venue, date and time) of what your wedding will be like when you buy your gown. Plus, if you check the weddit history, you will find a bunch of 'dress regret' posts - unfortunately, some brides bought their dress to early and later had a change of heart. Try to prevent that from happening. Look, try on, feel, but don't buy at your first appointment. If you find a dress you love, write down the information and if you still love it later - you can always go ahead and order it then!

Stadium = huge capacity.  Football, Baseball, Soccer.  (There are smaller stadiums, but generally folks think of the large stadiums).  Arena = medium capacity.  As a consequence, some arenas can offer excellent viewing from many seats.  Sometimes rear of stage is blocked off; sometimes not.  In a stadium, the average distance from viewer to stage is great.  Thus, at a stadium, a jumbo screen or more is provided for folks to look at, possibly special effects, etc.  Even an arena may have a screen to view, for folks in the back, or the rear of stage.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It is very rare that a single female performer will book stadium tours, since, it is difficult to fill the seats needed to justify a stadium tour.  As it stands now, the rear of stage seats are not being sold, reducing the numbers slightly.   An arena show can provide a more personal viewing of the act, than can a stadium, just as a club would provide a more intimate viewing than an arena.  However, just as watching a baseball game, or football / soccer game, there is excitement inside of a stadium generated by the enormous amount of people coming together for a particular purpose -- so there is buzz from that.        _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Consequently, people may be sitting on the floor of the upper level, near the snack bar, having a good time, because they are part of the event.  A party is significantly what you bring to it.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ TS is also in a few arenas (vs. stadiums) this year, as a subset of additional  groups (and thus fewer songs) starting in a few days.

You should look up some of the clips of Leeann on those USO tours. There was a lot of joking around and she did her share. As I stated before while it may have been in poor taste it wasn't malicious. In the pic she has a flak jacket on and he's barely touching it if at all. Hardly compares to Trump and Moore's attacks. To try to equate Franken's case with Trump or Moore is the definition of false equivalence.

I clearly disagree with your assessment of the level of danger in Shaw. Your knowledge seems limited to news articles, which isn’t helpful to people considering Shaw. People can google. You add nothing to the conversation because you can’t share any personal experiences about the neighborhood.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I’m absolutely fine with you telling people that you don’t like Shaw and that was one of your more reasonable posts. I’d be happy if you were able to give a balanced assessment with details on what you also like about the neighborhood. That said, if I think you’re wrong, I’ll make sure that I will make a comment to the contrary with actual experience to back it up.

Sorry, but 1v1 kills happen all the time. Much like other mobas, it's all about the matchup whether you can secure a 1v1 kill. That said, given the way XP works, the game facilitates roaming because you only need one person in each lane to secure XP. And in some cases, a particular hero can handle soaking multiple lanes, freeing you up to have even more roaming. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Strategy is different from Dota and LoL, for sure. There is less micro strategy around minion wave management (i.e., less about killing this particular minion or denying that particular minion). There is still macro wave management, though, and if you learn the game there is a lot of timing to it (i.e., you want to try to capture mercenaries and shove waves right before an objective spawns on most maps, forcing the other team to choose between defending structures or contesting the objective). It's ultimately not as high a burden of knowledge as Dota or LoL, but there's still plenty there.
That does help.  I was wondering If I should try and remember.  Do I need to get to the bottom of this or can I find a way to move on because it's doubtful I will get any answers?

home theater receivers typically have an output port which exports the same audio feed that you would usually hear coming out of the speakers attached to the receiver. So if you have like 5 HDMI inputs, you can connect this output port (typically an optical audio out port) to another speaker like a soundbar, and then no matter which HDMI input you're currently viewing/listening to, the receiver will route that input's sound to the speaker via the optical audio out.

It probably took about 3 weeks to 'heal' to the point where I could grip things like bike handlebars or a steering wheel with enough strength. It happened late July but I still cant bend my finger as much as I could before, when I bend it a lot it almost feels like the bones are crunching together, its quite painful. I think its just going to stay like this forever now.

She's just worried I'm not going anywhere with my life and wants to push me to do something and knows I've been showing an interest in art. I probably could of explained a little better she's not forcing me to do anything I just wanted a second opinion on the subject for me and her.

**What follows is My (Sullivan, Andrew, Expedition Home Director) account of the First Other Side expedition**:  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ **NOTE:** No names will be given for the crew due to the controversial nature of the mission and the Disastrous results. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The first expedition to the afterlife was sent with eight people in specially designed ship that tore its way through the fabric of the universe to eventually come out on the other side. The eight members of the mission represented the seven biggest religions and one atheist. Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Jewish, Wiccan, and even a Scientologist.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The ship dubbed the *Styx * was launched from the International Space Station and then flown to a designated entry/safety zone where it engaged its Rosen drives to spend three days tearing though the very fabric of reality to reach the great beyond.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ That part had been a success, the ship logs, and collected data showed as much. The only thing that was not as predicted on the journey was the sensors intermittent logging of life forms outside the ship. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It is when they arrived that everything went wrong. The ship logs show that the Rosen drives powered down correctly and the ship had entered an area of stable reality and zero-g space. In the next minute or so the ship logs show the crew doing what they were supposed to, sensors being powered up, data being down loaded, the crew chatting with each other, etc. As soon as the crew reads that the external light levels are safe the captain orders the main windows opened.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The next few minutes of the log show that the crew grows silent one by one. The ships interior cameras show all the crew staring out of the windows at their stations not doing anything. The first mate, the Christian starts weeping, followed quickly by the Muslim, the Hindu and the Jew. The Buddhist science officer starts bashing his head against the console in front of him, and no one moves to stop him. The Scientologist/communications officer starts screaming  until she runs out of breath, only to gasp for air and start screaming again. The Captain, the atheist, just starts saying F**k over and over for about 5 minutes straight before collapsing into sobs. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The on board cameras and recorders show that the entire crew devolved into preforming actions of self mutilation, violence, and destruction. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ After three hours the emergency jump command is activated by one of the crew, unknown who, and the ship starts its Rosan engines and begins its reality churning journey back to our reality. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Three days later the materialized at the same area that it had left and was pick up after not answering to any communications directed at them.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Three members of the initial eight were alive but suffering from various amounts of blood loss, blunt force trauma, lacerations, bite wounds, etc. The primary electrical engineer, the Wiccan had tore out her own eyes.  _back_to_line_ The three surviving members were as follows, The Captain (Atheist), The Physicist and Rosan Drive Engineer (Christian), and the The Primary Electrical Engineer (Wiccan). _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ All survivors were given medical attention and then place under sedation and Psychological watch until further notice. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I have interviewed each survivor of the Other Side mission and have come to the conclusion that their testimonies are truth. I have further advised that all data and ship interior camera logs be classified.    _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Crew interviews show that they came back changed, different and crazed. All described the same thing out the windows, and all described the same feeling.  _back_to_line_ They each described a vast, huge nebulous being sitting among the bodies of all the gods, in all the religions of the world. They saw all the souls of the dead being devoured as they entered that realm. But most of all each survivor described a feeling of loneliness and insignificance that radiated from this being.  _back_to_line_ The Captain in a rare lucid moment said that: _back_to_line_ &gt;*Loneliness is the only thing that could not be made into a fetish or a form of pleasure.* _back_to_line_ &gt;*It is worse than any hell I could have imagined.*  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ We knew there are always costs for being explores, but this, this was to much. I have viewed the footage from the external cameras and have verified the veracity of the crews findings and found all the claims true. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ **Addendum** _back_to_line_  Sullivan, Andrew, Expedition Home Director committed suicide by burning himself to death with all copies of the *Styx*'s external camera records only two hours after submitting this report. _back_to_line_

Anyways, I love them both and don't mean to undersell Marvel by any means. Just a hair more passionate about Star Wars. 👌🏻

To answer your question of how much is enough, its entirely up to you to decide with the tradeoff for loud or quiet or power hungry of a fan you can use. Now you have a video that shows what 78.5 mm H2O static pressure can do with a pop can, that should help with 50-100kph comparison from earlier: This fan is 111.764kph and your imaginary fan is 1.23kph

&gt; If you want a market to be free and driven by competing entrepreneurs then the negative attribution is that it will not be a heavily regulated government driven economy. For it to be driven by the competing interests of private individuals it necessarily follows that it will not be a market driven by a mammoth and byzantine government sector. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I mean, this is mostly true in terms of simple regulation and encroachment, but the government sector (especially in America) has done more to push the market than any private enterprises have or even could. The biggest example being that most of the innovative and ingenious ideas of today revolve around the internet, which wouldn't have existed if it hadn't been for nearly 60 years of the US military spending billions of dollars on computer technology. A lot of the country's economic history has been centered around the government tackling some new territorial or technological frontier, and then 40 years later after they've mostly figured it out businesses then swoop in to optimize the information the government has gained. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I also think the *little to no market regulation* government is kind of a paradox. Like you mentioned with the mercantilism and like we're seeing today in the US, it's impossible to actually achieve such a state unless you regulate against lobbying and money in politics. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ To summarize, I think we agree that too much regulation is a problem. I'm also arguing that the government has other ways of intervening in the economy besides the sheer *do this, don't do that*, and most of them have proven themselves incredibly useful.

It's literally being considered a stable store of value more so than a currency right now, so it actually works perfectly according to your description.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Also the fees are typically set by wallets automatically choosing a high fee to ensure the transaction goes through. They prioritize speed over cost. Some wallets allow you to set a fee manually and the transactions still go through, just a bit slower. There are frequent reports of 20 cent transaction fees on /r/bitcoin.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Once Lightning is released it should (in theory) take off as a currency because it is theoretically infinitely available scalable.

That should alleviate the bottlenecks.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Also if you are worried about fees IOTA is completely feeless. :)

You can abandon the apartment, turn in your keys and they’ll sue you for the rent owed/you’ll pay until they re-rent it. It could be longer than the one month they’re asking you to pay. Or you can go nicely and sign up for one of their exit plans. You’re better off paying the one month and being done with it. Utilities won’t be much at all as they use the electric to show the apartment and clean it/paint/etc. some water and gas to heat it. Maybe a total of $60 for the month or so?  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Either way you can choose to abandon it and hope they don’t f you over by taking longer to turn it and slow to rent it or pay the one month.

Would selling your house after coming to that realization, but before actually being in that new financial situation, be seen as anything but rational?

Maybe you think the reasoning is self-evident, and obviously not every post should be read as a well-formulated essay, but it doesn't seem to me as if that part added anything to the discussion. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Cal it elitist, but it might be the case that many who frequent this part of Reddit think it ought to be a place where thoughts can be shared openly without interference from the echo chamber and that ideas should be conveyed clearly and be well thought-out. Of course, in attempting to escape the echo chamber it becomes the echo chamber, but that's a different issue.
if you have the paperwork you might be able to have them stop child support all together. You could claim that you've had suspicion that it wasn't yours before the 2 year period was up, but wasn't aware that there was something you could do about it.

Uh, no, where does it say that? The article says that most of Japan's current immigrants are temporary workers, but it also says that *[Japan] wants more skilled immigration - engineers, entrepreneurs, researchers, managers and professionals.* They are trying to attract permanent residents, and make it easier for them to become citizens.

The reason they are asking for so much money is to negotiate you down and make you think you got a good deal when you settle for $200, remember they probably bought your debt for less than $5. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Third you were a minor when this account was opened and are probably not liable unless you engaged in activity after you became a legal adult. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ When they call back next time tell them you know nothing about this debt, you want written proof of the debt and only wish to communicate by mail and under no circumstances would like to receive any calls in regards to this issue. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Remember that they are in this for a few dollars and once you stand up for yourself it is no longer worth their time and they will move on

I'm not arguing it isn't a multicolor card that is both green and white. I'm arguing that for deck construction purposes it was designed to be treated as green *or* white. Since we're discussing deck construction rules, this distinction matters. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *Color identity* wasn't even a thing in Magic until it was created for the sole purpose of making the rule we're discussing modifying in the first place. *If we change this rule, then it won't match with the rule before we changed it* is a tautology, not an argument against changing the rule.
I'd like to comment on this as an emergency physician working in Winnipeg. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Wait times are definitely significantly down. The most recent data from the past few months is even better than described in this article, but I don't think it's supposed to be fully public yet so I'm not going to get in shit for posting specifics on here. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ This is mostly due to systems changes that are independent of whats been happening with consolidation, and have been going on for at least the past two years. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ To clarify some of the misinformation that's been spread, the metrics mentioned in this article have not been changed in anyway from prior years. This is all based on numbers from CIHI, not from a WRHA publication. CIHI data is standardized and they have not changed how they measure anything.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ You can review this data in more detail by going to CIHI's website, or reviewing some of the raw data (excel file - https://www.cihi.ca/sites/default/files/document/nacrs-2016-2017-qs-static-table-en.xlsx ). _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The wait times website has changed since October. In the past, it showed the longest current wait for a treatment space. If you were place in a room you were no longer considered waiting to be seen... even if a physician never saw you for another 4 hours. The current system is now predictive - it tells you how long you can expect to wait to see a physician (not time to treatment space) if you show up right now, based on the 90%ile value for current ED conditions compared to historical averages. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Wait times in the city will likely settle out around, or just slightly above, the national average for the next few months - this is where they've been since maybe August.

Fair enough. That is true. But they *DO* provide the IRS with a person's gains for the year.

A woman can wield a car or a stilleto or a gun or a knife etc etc just as well as man. If a feminist makes the argument that women are intellectually the equals of men, then it holds to reason that they are just as capable of using tools as men, and can do so maliciously and even murderously.

I am not strongly pro-life but someone in another thread put it really well. IF you were really strongly pro-life then you'd essentially view abortion as genocide, and in turn I understand how you could stomach something even as bad as what Moore is accused of to avoid furthering genocide. I mean as crazy as it may sound, if you truly believe that abortion is murder the logic isn't that hard to follow through.

Who is to say it isn't? Illidan is crazy powerful as it is. There is absolutely no reason to believe that making him Lightforged would make him weaker/keep him the same, the opposite in fact. The Lightforged are augmented and immortal from what they were. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ What Xe'ra offered -- terribly, I might add -- was redemption. Being a demon is not exactly a very nice experience. We know that the Illidari have visions of Legion atrocities from time to time, they are constantly hungry for energy/power etc. Illidan is always going on about sacrifices because they are very much real; he has lost much and exists in a relatively shitty state simply to achieve this singular goal, which is admirable on its own. But from our POV it's just as liekly that with her power he would've been free of any torment at the expense of needing to serve the Light. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ In effect, what the parent and the OP is talking about is selfishness... 100% warranted selfishness considering how the bloody Naaru went about trying to convert him, but for an elf claiming to be 100% selfless wrt achieving his goal of ending the Legion, the sacrifice of his freedom (to a largely benevolent force even!) sounds a bit hypocritical.

Own up. You are waiting for the Saints to lose so you can justify why you thought they were overrated. Oh you were saying for the past week 'the Saints are legit'. But when Washington was up 31-16 with 6 minutes left, you were saying 'they've had an easy schedule'. When Brees stopped throwing for 300 and 4 you were thinking 'he's getting old and regressing'. But the 2017 Saints are used to playing gritty, they have played from behind and they have overcome adversity in other games. They aren't overrated.

I’ve tried various settings and levels of temp.

They sell like 12 things and only ever have about 7 in stock, they've *never* had Naito's Destino shirt in stock despite it always being front and center on the page, I had to resort to eBay to buy one (very glad I did too since the bloke I bought it from threw in a L.I.J hat) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Shipping prices are astronomical in Scotland too, damn near doubles the price

It makes perfect sense to me, but I've been working consistently and daily with logarithms for about 5 years.

Think of the poor bar staff. They get falsely accused of sexual assault, are insulted and degraded by a couple of spoiled individuals, and meanwhile they are just trying to do their job in the service industry. If you don't have respect for the people who serve you and cater your fancy ass *1000 dollar* tab, you are a narcissistic asshole. The way they actively distort what is happening on their social media too... makes me wonder if they have kind of brainwashed themselves or if they are just utter clowns.

I would but well...I spent a lot of time on the b.net forums and if I may speak my mind fully.

 Officers and snipers can find areas that suits them best. For instance if I am in a fire fight with somebody who then takes cover, I’ve done a lot of damage to him, so the sniper that’s up on a hill and has a better vantage point will kill him in one hit. As for the officer, their best place is probably near a firefight where they can use their abilities to boost their allies that are stuck at chokepoints. Sure you can’t say all right everybody let’s move up, but you can be there to play support even if you can’t discuss it. But I agree, I would like some form of communication system added into this game. 
I can't comment on opening an account from the US, but I have used several banks in Canada. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I've found the Royal Bank (RBC) quite good for personal use over the past 25+ years, and is very convenient to work with from various countries due to their extensive web and phone access. I prefer RBC for small business accounts too, and have used most major Canadian banking institutions for various businesses over the years. Other banks fare well for larger business accounts, about equal with RBC in that regard. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ RBC rates are consistent with other Canadian banks, but there tends to be less variance here than in the US.

Yeah, because your head of hair is thousands of individual things moving together, it's going to be extremely hard to get right with a sinplified version when there is no budget for more detail.

I usually only see optimal to mean point of diminishing returns, as while going past it might yield slightly better results, it's usually not worth the management of resources. An example would be your caloric intake in reference to your TDEE. If you're trying to put on lbm and minimize your fat gain, there's a number above your TDEE (I usually see 300-500 calories) that will give you what you want.

&gt;And it's much easier for me to imagine that these policies might be motivated by something other than greed or malice or cowardice when it comes to a man whose time is drawing to a close. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I can't imagine why.  He's as establishment GOP as establishment GOP gets, and their core ideology is *greed or malice or cowardice.* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;GOP donors are knocking down doors trying to get this bill passed. If they lose these donors the entire Republican party will be in serious jeopardy. Maybe McCain is trying ensure the continued existence of a party he's given an entire career to. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If he's willing to harm the *entire nation* to preserve his political party, I classify that under *greed or malice or cowardice.*  Talking about a return to normalcy and American values, then throwing the entire country under the bus for his donors is the fucking DEFINITION of spineless. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;Maybe he's been threatened with something of a personal nature or maybe there is something he intends to do before withdrawing from congress, and this is being held hostage. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Yeah maybe?  And maybe he got a literal visit from actual Jesus and a host of angels who promised to heal his cancer and care for his family in perpetuity if he voted for this bill.  Maybe Alex Jones is wearing his skin and the real John McCain was murdered by Hillary Clinton 30 years ago.  Indulging in silly hypotheticals is just that - silly - and so is the suggestion that he's voting for this because he's being literally coerced. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;We might also consider that killing the ACA repeal on the floor of the Senate was something of a power play between GOP leadership and Trump. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Not sure what this has to do with John McCain voting for this bill. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;What is clear to me is not depravity on McCain's part, it is that serious strings are being pulled and it is unclear how or by whom. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ So you think it's more plausible that he's being *literally threatened or blackmailed*, than that he's just a sorta shitty dude who puts his political party first and talks a big game but doesn't really care much about the good of the nation?  Okay, sure.  If you're that locked into hero worshiping this guy, I guess nothing *anyone* can say will change your mind.

I am very sad to hear you youth was like this. I find it mind blowing that people had to *get away* with liking a different genre. For comparison, I had a friend in high school that had the best grades in class, played basketball, is fit, is hard core into anime/manga, avidly plays video games, plays DnD from time to time, is really into EDM and rap, knows a bit about cars, etc. and it was *because* of his varied tastes that everyone knew him and liked him because he can talk to basically everyone about everything. Now that I think of it though, most of the well liked peers in my class/stream were the ones who wanted to be everyone's friends and liked a wide variety of things. And yet, compared to your experienced, this would have been a liability rather than an asset. I'm not sure if it was because I was in an all boys school, but there was a true sense of comradery and brotherhood between the students. I went to high school in Toronto, Canada, however before then I was in the public school system in Orlando, USA. Even then though, I do not really recall much bullying, at least none that I've seen. I would have been a prime target too, given my (at that time) Spanish accent and my *nerdy* interests (I'm not sure what's considered nerdy anymore though since everything that used to be *nerdy* is mainstream). I openly talked about cartoons, books, and video games with my friends and received absolutely no hate for it from anyone. You could make the argument though that it was because we were still kids, but from what my old friends have told me, high school in Orlando wasn't too bad at all, very little bullying or malicious behavior. In fact, people will turn against you if you are mean to others, at least when it comes to their hobbies and sexuality. Also, schools now clamp down hard on violence, so forget even touching someone without their permission. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Also, I am not British, and our school system works differently, so I am kind of lost regarding the terms used in the last sentence. I found this [useful](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/c0/aa/6e/c0aa6e69a586a2a798b926e5577d43e0--school-grades-the-school.jpg) chart though, and I assume it's accurate. In Florida and in most of the country (I assume), K-5 is Elementary, 6-8 Middle, 9-12 High School. You can technically drop out at 16 years old (they might have changed it), but it is the norm and it is expected that you finish High School.

No they aren’t expensive, but my understanding is that they are not 100% subsidized. Japanese have to pay for every doctor visit, and a portion of every vaccination. They also seem quite scared of complications compared to most of the countries I have ever been to. My understanding also is that many parents opt out of childhood vaccinations for their children, reaching levels which basically means herd immunity is not achieved.

Just another federal diet election like the one in late September from what I understand. A simple repeat of the entire process, only a few months after the last one. The federal president doesn't seem to want this to happen, but he's essentially just a figurehead and the SPD leadership has claimed that they would prefer another election over a grand coalition, and Merkel said that she would prefer them over a minority government as well.

Trump has explicitly cast his support for a candidate with multiple sexual impropriety allegations against him (even if you don't believe they are true, many Republicans have come out saying they are believable enough that he should be immediately removed from office if elected), has been removed several times from the Alabama Supreme Court, and has described himself as *virulently anti-gay*, among other charges that can be levied against him. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I've never defended Moore but I've also never criticized him. I think Moore is a dangerous precedent to set, where you're guilty before proven innocent. it's also obviously political. They decided to make the accusations at a time where the ballot can't be changed... it's not as if these things happened a few weeks ago. They definitely chose their time on purpose. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;His opponent is probably the best candidate Democrats could ever run in Alabama, but Trump would rather side with a huge political liability than even attempt to pass legislation that could garner one or two Democrat votes. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ See above about setting a precedent.

That's not the impression I got at all from OP, especially considering their replies elsewhere. The post only specifies instances where that gameplan actually both happened at all and actually worked, and apparently frequently fails or otherwise cannot be attempted either. The biggest Flag for me was the DM asking for insight towards OP when OP has done nothing overtly or covertly deceptive *in-character* (regardless of what OoC might have happened) towards the party. It sounds to me like the DM is inviting suspicion against OP for either no reason, or a reason they haven't seen fit to share with OP or ask their permission for/involvement in, and OP finds it un enjoyable.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If other players or the DM have a problem, the correct course is to say something about it. Maybe try to make it known in-character, definitely make t known out of character, and try to work something out. Don't get petty and create weird circumstances where OP has no idea what's going on, and especially don't start doing something like that on a whim apropos of nothing and make it seem like something's wrong when there isn't. Likewise OP needs to talk to the DM about the insight rolls and make it clear nothing is happening, so why are the rolls, and to the players again to ensure they know whatever OP's actions against others the party are totally in the clear. 
The idea is that the police uniform is a negative thing for many lgbt people who have experience violence and discrimination at the hands of police officers. So they’ve been banned from participating in the parade in order to protect the people who are scared of police

Take Joe Scarborough for instance, who has raised questions about Trump's mental stability for at least a few months now. On Thursday's *Morning Joe,* the anchor called on Trump's Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment, because he is *mentally unfit,* which would remove him from office. *People close to him say he is mentally unfit, people close to him during the campaign told me he had early stages of dementia,* Scarborough said. *Now listen, you can get mad at me.

Watched, and paused after the intro. I am beyond blown away at your response, its truly amazing. I just want you to know that you don't owe us SHIT, not an apology or anything. Like I said in my previous comments, I love your content, I think you are the best tutorial/learning content creators for the majority of the CS population. You generally talk about things that are interesting for everybody, and while they aren't complex topics like this one are very valuable. This is different, and is why I wanted to give you the feedback. I hope I was not too harsh in my criticism and apologize if I made you feel bad - that was not my intent. I'm going to finish watching now. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ What an improvement! Just really a great improvement. There was a real flow to the video, and you didn't ever drift off talking about unrelated stuff. This was 10x better. I don't necessarily agree with everything you said, but I think its good enough and simply explained enough. Seriously well done.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If you thought sound was an interesting form of map control... I'll give you two more things to think about... _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ - Absence of sound...  _back_to_line_ - Time... (If nobody on your team is still in the forest and a tree falls, does the tree really fall? - haha... weird way to beat around the bush but i didnt know how to give a hint without explaining it) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Feel free to PM me if you want to shoot the shit about ideas and concepts and stuff, id be more than willing to give you feedback (I'm actually interested in getting into the tutorial game myself - this whole exchange spurred that, but thinking about more of a written format than video).

Oops I didn't notice this. Some of the data may be skewed for those questions just keep it in mind! Very interesting, thought provoking survey.

 BPD is the reason I keep away from romantic relationships. All of the symptoms - over-sensativity, the push and pull of emotional validation needs spiraling into arbitrary hatred, impulsive and harmful behaviors attempting to provide myself with some sort of self-satisfaction - are significantly exacerbated when I have any interaction with an intimate relationship. Added to this is the insurmountable guilt I feel when I have irrationally lashed out at the people who care most about me. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ This, I suppose, has been the most tangible impact. As a young woman, I'm constantly being asked why I'm perpetually single and the result is an inner monologue pertaining to being harmful for others to get close to. It has a way of making you feel defective, toxic, and, above all else, lonely.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ There are, however, perks to this disorder. I'm essentially an emotion savant. I'm super, super sensitive to other people. For me, feeling out a person's feelings, even when they're hiding it seemingly well,  is as easy as a side glance. It helps greatly with giving advice or being the best friend in the group to lend an understanding ear, but it is also incredibly exhausting.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Coping wise, I have found that the best way for me to respond to any stimulus that has me wanting to flip into the 'I fucking hate you' side of things is getting away. I need time for the emotion to settle. You see, I'm great at other people and their feelings, but am horrid at my own. It is normal for someone with BPD to have an overtly overwhelming emotion, one that stuns you as it fills your every sense, and not be able to figure out what the emotion is. I have to use context to assume what the feeling *might* be and I'm not always right. That's why getting away and having some time for the feeling to pass is so, so essential for me to communicate in a healthy way. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ As for the intense bouts of loneliness? I have three cats and a dog. They offer so much love and for such little incentive. They are my angels.

So I wanted to know what survives the 3 Major Removal cards you can play around vs Magmar.  Plasma Storm, Rebuke, &amp; Lavaslasher.  To much surprise not much does survive.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ What I'm for hoping is that this saves people the time of looking through their collection to see what will work in this meta so I posted it here.  Again it is not much but it's better than nothing. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I, For One, Welcome Our New Lizard Overlords until a patch fixes this glaring issue.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ No faction in the game should have this much overloaded removal and have the best finisher.  If Saurian Finality wasn't around I don't think this would be an issue really.  Removal is only as good as your win condition.
I'm guessing it will be: _back_to_line_ Rand, Olive, Loudermilk/ _back_to_line_ Baun, Van Ginkel, Edwards, Connelly/ _back_to_line_ Carryer Williams, Dixon, Burrell or Seth Currens, Cone _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ There will be a significant dropoff next year

I agree with you on that. I think with the chance me's, its really all subjective. For colleges with large acceptance rates, its pretty easy to predict, but colleges with low acceptance rates are harder to predict. I think with CC and Reddit chance me's, you really have to take advice from both. While CC is a toxic place, there can be some honest people on there. And with Reddit, you just have to be realistic too. Do you have any outstanding achievements or EC's that could help you in the admissions process?

My pipe dream is a future where company fundraising comes in the form of ICOs so that anyone can invest in a company at any round of funding. Basically give the public access to the early rounds that are now limited to venture capitalists and those with a networth of &gt;1m. Then as those ICOs mature into large global companies their coins will be traded like stocks are today. And all of it on a decentralized technology that circumvents all the fuckery of wallstreet and the big investment banks.
Trigun is one popular show that is heavily inspired by the US Wild West, and it's main cast has names like Nicholas, Milly, and Meryl. Fullmetal Alchemist is another popular show which is set in a place inspired by Germany, although I can't get much further into that without spoiling the original show. The cast in both of these are primarily white.

Of course they are. Why does every athlete/celebrity have to start one in their own name? Why not just simply donate to established charities? Because you can’t hire your friends and family to run established charities. You certainly can’t pay your family member $300,000 a year to run a golf tournament that brings in $15,000 dollars and has annual donations of $500,000, with $485,000 coming from the celebrity.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Check out guidestar  and charity navigator to see which are shady.

Why do you assume linear progression in birth rates? There's no reason to believe that will occur. I don't know off-hand the long-term data for Europe (it could be different here in the US we've made a assimilating immigrants a fairly strong part of our culture) but in the US TFR falls to normal about the third generation. A new family from a high TFR culture will have a lot of kids. Their kids will have more than average but less than their parents. Their kids are a bit below replacement rate just like everyone else. A broader study (I've kept mostly to the last century because we have better records) shows an inverse correlation between wealth and TFR in almost all countries. 
Just to be clear I did not make this in Survival at all, I held a map in Creative and switched to Spectator to fill in the maps faster.

When a game has to bring back classic servers, it is already catering to an older, nostalgic player base, not a new one. The game stopped drawing new players with the advent of so much competition, especially cheaper competition. It also was not updated quickly enough to compete with new launches (that's to be expected; it is harder to make drastic changes in a released game than one to be released). _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It also suffers from being the butt of so many jokes and being associated with *extreme nerdiness* while shooters are still on that border edge and growing in societal popularity (MOBA's are as well but are a bit slower on that front). And it suffers from being simply old - it's just not new. People like new. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Not a criticism of WoW in itself, but rather, WoW being aged out is just an inevitable conclusion really no matter how well it was run.

Someone has to. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ We're talking the difference between a 45 point outing or a 30 point outing every time LeBron comes to town. What do you prefer? Better or worse defenders? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Our big weakness is our inability to ever contain star wings. Andre Iguodala and Kawhi Leonard both won finals MVPs strictly on the back of the fact that they had to guard LeBron for the series and *held him* to monster performances.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If we want to ever compete for the title it's not going to happen without above average wing defenders. We currently have one, Millsap, and he's overloaded as a weakside/frontcourt help defender covering Jokić's tracks. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If your argument is that Winslow isn't a good defender, that's different, but just because superstars can score at will doesn't mean we shouldn't even try to improve our ability to defend the multitude of star wings in the league.

Good reasoning for why people in general should read Darwin but for the very specific purpose of learning about how evolution works it just isn't a good place to start.
The typical accessory to suppress noise on an S9 I've seen is a cooler with flexible ducts for intake and exhaust. Another person here built a muffling box recently too with a loose writeup on it (last week I think?).  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I'll be building one in January when mine gets in - sound reducing foam and insulation, double walled box, possibly low vacuum between the box walls, etc.
He owed an X-girlfriend from 15 years ago about 4 grand for a loan she gave him so he could get a car .(she had to take him to court to get repaid and only NOW that this information has been made public due to the political race will she be paid it seems ) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ And she states  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *Slechta sees her ex-boyfriend's struggles being a result of him *making horrible life choices* that *screwed* her over, and not a result of factors outside his control. She also noted that even though she is a single working mother, she always pays her bills.* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ In my book it's one thing to be indebted to an entity but quite another to an actual person .like you've give your word to that person that you will repay them . In my mind it's inconceivable to not repay a personal debt like that ... _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Democrats are really draining the swamp for candidates I guess .

Whoah, sick team dude, congrats :O _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The other option i have as i was talking about with the other guy that commented is selling my vidal, boateng and alaba, actually using kolasinac as a lb alongside sif mustafi who i have untradeable aswell and maybe putting baby blanc as the left midfielder  (my midfield would then be blanc on the left, bakayoko in the middle and pogba on the right in a 4312)

Don't call me Shirley. 
I think he needs either 1) one more year in the SHL but playing as a center. Put more weight on. Then once the season is over. Sign him play him, play him in the nhl. OR 2) Sign him this year. Play him in Utica. Try and get him used to the NA game. Play him at center. Then he could possibly be a call up guy  if he earns his way up. 
Mushroom, red wine, acid, onion, garlic, herbs and fat (cream or butter or both). _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I experiment with herbs and it depends on what the protein is for what herb is selected. Really I just play around until my sauce tastes good. No recipes usually.

If EA hadn't had their grubby fingers near this game, I would have bought it. They've only brought shame to the Star Wars franchise. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ To those of you bought it, yes, I know, I love Star Wars too. It's just that EA makes its business predating on the weak wills of the mindless consumer. It's why they think they can get away with making such horrible business decisions when it comes to big-bucks franchises like Star Wars. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The fact that so many people rewarded their sly and scummy behaviour and practices by buying the game makes me want to throw my arms up in the air and give up. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It amuses me that so many who complained about EA, then turned around and rewarded EA with money. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ You complained about the bad behaviour, then rewarded bad behaviour. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ You asked for this. You have no right to complain.

Fellow PNWer here. I guess I'm a little confused as to why a jacket is necessary. When it rains it isn't really that cold. Just throw on a long sleeve, gloves, and a hat. Once you are soaked you can't get any more wet, and I find the water actually starts to act as insulation.
So you don't know and you have no sources, thanks for clearing that up.

You got downvoted. But I appreciated it.
Yeah, I, figured. *That* TV belt was always my favorite. I mean, the silver and red was classic, of course, but I came back to watching WCW regularly again around '93 when Paul Orndorff held it, and that's about when I went from being a believer to being more hardcore fan. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I also always liked the Georgia territory's [National Television title](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d1/29/a2/d129a2bab0a6d7fc267278c2eec0ea3d.jpg) from before the WWF bought them out. It was held by guys like Jake Roberts, Tommy Rich, and Ronnie Garvin, but it was abandoned and not included in the lineage of the NWA World Television Title, which came from the Mid-Atlantic TV title. 
My loan was 30,000 bells, I paid of 10,000 right away, and two days ago I paid another 10,000. But today my loan is up to 20,000 bells! What gives?

&gt; in reality, such people of concern do not posses any power. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Nope, they do.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Speaking from experience this Tan Sri mobilised the entire polis bantuan squadron (8 of them) who reports to the local police station because his driver likes to park at the wrong place. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ When challenged the driver claimed that he wants to pray and people can’t stop him (using religion as a weapon even though he doesn’t even live here), but the surau is at the other side of the compound (quite far). He got his car clammed and he can’t use religion to wing it because we ain’t dumbfucks so he called the Tan Sri and the Tan Sri called the police. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ So what do you think? No power? Nah, they certainly do.

Thats literally your bank account, PIN and TAN-list. Or short: Then he's got your funds. It would be easier to try to guess a bank account login, then the required PIN and the 6 digit tan in a row, 10 times in a row with 10 different (unknown) bank accounts :)

I guess so yeah :/ I tried playing with a controller again because of the movement, but the aiming is just so weird on controller to me now that I’ve switched to PC.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I see where you’re coming from, I wish Xbox supported K/M for those whom wanted to use it without spending a fortune on a good PC.

I am not hitting the wrong stuff in fact there is more to why old school MMO players don't like or play BDO. In my post i meant some of those things as not exactly being negative but not really features that should be in an MMORPG. AFK tasks sure. I wish there was some other form of progressing life skills without having to leave the screen when I'm having fun or wanting to play. Variety in that would bring more players since it would expand the *To do things* other than grinding 24/7 when at the monitor.  Then there is the single player. Where there is practically no group content ingame. Then comes the gender locked classes aswell. Why can't I play a male ranger or a female berserker for example. Things like that is why it's never gonna be the next great thing. (Let's not even mention the cash shop) *cough or the electricity bill monthly subscription of 10€ for leaving your PC on all the time for said AFK progress. Anyhow you are being in the defensive. If you truly enjoy the game you shouldn't let other people opinions about it affect you. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Edit: when I said hosted in valencia6 I meant exactly what you thought I meant. ;) _back_to_line_ Oh and yeah one time my guild *mate* left his character on for 4 days straight progressing his strength due to having to travel. So i'm not sure about dumb but no matter how insignificant it is it's still progress without touching the game is it not? There was no need to call names or get upset about my opinion and obviously many others about this game. We are afterall all adults here I hope (in this post). Also not really sure on the group content but when I played with my wife few months back it was an awful experience in that department. Atleast compared to GW2 or FFXIV or even Aion. Hell even Revelation Online had more group content.
r/loseit _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ r/fitness _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The first thing you should do is cut out all sodas and fruit juice. Sugar and hfcs wreak havoc on the hormones that control satiety and hunger. Eat a good amount of protein and don't be afraid of healthy fats. With a healthy, balanced diet, you should naturally feel less hungry and be less gravitated towards sweets. At this point, even Ice Cream is too sweet for me and a spoonful is all I can handle. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Losing weight is a lifestyle change. Your weight loss should be sustainable and enjoyable, not a punishment. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ You can also head over to r/fatlogic to get a healthy dose of science-backed retorts against some of the silly misconceptions we have about dieting and obesity. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Good luck!

Carrying on like all this is normal is the most frustrating thing about NPR right now.

I hope they dont trash red dead with too many loot crate systems. 
Derfor har vi brug for *Adserving international*? Så de kan udnytte den data udelukkende til eget forbrug? Så Adserving International kan hjælpe DR med at finde ud af hvad folk ser på DR.dk? Jeg er virkelig ikke overbevist. Jeg kan forstå Gemius, jeg kan forstå Google. Jeg kan endda forstå en manglende forståelse for hvad det vil sige at inkludere standard Share-knapper på sin webside. Men det der er ude over fornuft. Vi burde mindst være tilbudt nogen svar, og komplet transparens over hvad den info bliver brugt til, hvordan de når deres konklusioner for næste sendeflade osv. Det er naivt at tro at DR ikke ved hvad de laver, og ikke ved hvad de sender ud til hele sjælland. Det er også naivt at tro at de ikke ved hvor ringe det er, og at de ikke står med en bedre løsning.
Okay, I got one more: *what about* the Social Democrats? The first time you mentioned them, I assumed that you meant Social Democrats in Russia and I didn't see how they could even vaguely be blamed for Hitler, but now you're specifying that it's the *German* ones to blame and saying they doomed *all of humanity*. That's an awfully heavy charge and something I'd definitely like to hear more about.

First of all, thanks for taking your time to write such a lengthy post. Also, thanks for pointing out the divide in the community. Content creators (and their following) are a great example to illustrate this! _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ In your second post you mention several things I would like to respond to: _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *None of them however want their money back, since there is still a small chance we actually might get a game someday.* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ You refer to a small chance, but wouldn't one assume that given the amount of money, progress and media attention that's invested in this game, there's a rather big chance that it will (eventually) come out. Besides, the consequences of failing this project would have a big impact on CIG (and Chris for that matter). Of course the risk of failure is still present (especially since the scope keeps / kept expanding). But to my understanding, this risk was far bigger years ago, when development was less prominent. Then there's also a huge financial incentive for launching this project. Whether or not it will be of quality, seems to me as a bigger risk. I'd reckon a lot of features will be cut, or at least trimmed down in early roll-out versions. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ As to you and your friends' personal motivations: I personally enjoy the immersive, realistic approach. But it comes with a lot of extra work of course. I would love to invade a planet, raid a settlement and escape back to space with space cops or player controlled bounty hunters on my tail ;). That's also the issue with this game, the possibilities are nearly endless.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Regarding procedural generation: I understand the merits of this technique for landscaping etc. But I fear the implementation of random generated quests. Or more specifically, the lack of hand-made quests. I'm aware Squadron 42 is being shaped into a story driven campaign, but this is single player, and kind of separated from SC right? _back_to_line_  
why would you cut someone who is so good though???
Make sure you have the modified power armor. But I think I moved around on the rock formation and shot bombs, the arrows that knock of components,  and piercing arrows. I think I tried focusing on taking one out then the other one. Or another suggestion I've seen is to hang back just outside their area and fire and retreat then repeat. 
It’s Starlord, man.
Fent bars are very rare. Most of the time people who think they have fent bars just have alp bars that were accidentally dosed a little too high. It doesn’t make sense from a dealers business standpoint. Why take the HUGE risk of hurting or killing someone with fent bars when the real things are much safer and cheaper and easier to get and less illegal and people love them lol. There’s literally no reason for anyone to make fentanyl Xanax presses, that’s why it’s actually very rare, it’s just become a meme on this sub, because anything Xanax related becomes a meme on this sub.
True, Kaufland has great prices (It's my favorite Supermarket) but Lidl can make cheap a lot of items of their inventory, items like the extra old Gouda cheese for example, Kaufland only sells old and sometimes they can't even keep up with the price of the Lidl one _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I dislike Real for no reason , I've actually spent time thinking about it in the past and I can't figure out why I prefer Kaufland

That sucks man. I mean, that sort of thing is supposed to hurt, you're human, and it doesn't reflect poorly on you at all. You'll be stronger for it, maybe strengthen your individual resolve more, and make you a better person for when you do find the actual right person. It is a gift to feel something, even if it is heartbreak, because it means you have a lot of love inside of you to offer *for the right person*. You know what I mean? Pain is part of the experience of living life, the better you know pain, the more you can feel its absence.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Look at it this way, she couldn't last nine months of a bad time, so clearly she wouldn't have lasted a lifetime of marriage. She wasn't the one. Actual love and commitment endures that shit, it doesn't falter outside of fair weather. Finding the right person is trial and error, it's not an easy path, but you're a goddamn soldier and you're a goddamn man, so while some may wallow in self-pity, you're going to get back on the horse and continue blazing a trail towards the person you're actually supposed to be with. Be the best goddamn self you can be, don't let anybody stop you from doing that, not some chick that walked out on you, and definitely not yourself getting in your own head.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I prescribe for you to watch some action movies, hit the gym, and don't let that bitch steal your man card from you, because the actual hot piece of ass that you're supposed to end up with is out there and she's going to expect you to have it. Get some.

Go back and pick up that handle you just flew off of. It was an honest medical question, not an insurance based one (hence me noting *outside of an insurance discussion*). Like I have any way of knowing how old you are or if your condition requires removal of both ovaries.

May I ask how they were preserved? I have 2 blankets from my late grandmother for my 2 daughters. They're the only crocheted things of hers I have- we regularly display other things she had/ gave or I inherited as much as possible but I would love to know how to preserve these 2 items.

At a time when Mueller's investigation is chugging along at a fast clip, Trump and his inner circle should be going to the mattresses and preparing for when the hammer finally drops. Instead, he's basically screaming with a bullhorn, *I WILL THROW YOU UNDER THE BUS.* A man who demands utmost loyalty but offers none in return is weak and undeserving of said loyalty. 
He doesn't sound like a human.

People are acting like this shit hasn't been around for decades...since fucking baseball cards. Is there any evidence that the generation who grew up with pokemon cards are more susceptible to gambling than the last? I don't understand where all of this hysteria is coming from.

Your melody composition is very interesting. Some parts are simple on their own but the layers come together to convey emotion. Your voice is clean and your modulation and pitch add a refreshing level of harmony. I like how you attack the guitar when it's appropriate, and caress it when the song calls for something subdued.

Firstly I’d like to say after rereading my reply I sounded like a total dick, I apologize for any offense, I was expecting the standard “whydoncha just put an LS in it” so my apologies for my above comment.  _back_to_line_ Second, I too work on diesels (farm equipment mostly) so I  shouldn’t generalize what other people have tuned this engine for as that’s just hyperbole and I wouldn’t boost mine to that extent.  _back_to_line_ Id definitely wouldn’t be expecting a warranty buying this engine, it only ships with a 90 day anyways. I should also explain that I don’t really need or want a lot of power. The stock 3.6 only makes 260 ftlbs at around 4k in my Jeep. In stock form the 2.8 makes about 260-270 at around 1500-3000. Already this is enough power for me, not that I would keep it completely stock.

&gt;You're also exaggerating the horizontal difference. a 16:9 ratio screen is only about 1.3 times the length a 4:3 screen.

A word cloud sounds like your best bet here, unless you want to spend a long time wading through each open and coding them. While a word cloud won't offer as much in-depth info that you could present in a graph-form, it will give you a quick glimpse of common elements that you could display easily into a report/presentation. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ A great word cloud tool which I use all the time is [wordle](http://www.wordle.net/create). Paste in all the open ends from a question and it will automatically create a word cloud which you can visually tweak using a bunch of pre-set fonts, color palettes, and orientation. Then simply just screenshot it and save/copy-paste it into your presentation/report/whatever. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It's super easy to use, but the only downside is that it uses java, so you may find you won't be able to use Chrome to use it (since they stopped supporting java applications recently). I've found IE works well (and it's the only reason I keep it installed on my PC!) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Hope this helps - let me know if you need any more info :)

I'd do the split at the 6* junction. So a 6* Y or T splitter with a 3* reducer to your current setup and an open end to the future setup. This way you're not cornered into a 3* setup down the line, you just get whichever reducer you wind up needing.

I just want some speed options like u said about AI. _back_to_line_ -caravans need to go faster. U literally can’t do anything when in one so just please speed that shit to its destination, maybe 5x speed? But have the option to go it’s current speed so u can stop at towns along the way if u need. They used to go faster before official release... _back_to_line_ -maybe add a 4x option when traveling on foot, this would be risky early I realize but when it’s day 200 and ur not worried about being jumped by anything and u just want to get to the edge of the wilderness to pillage it’d be nice to go faster. _back_to_line_ -an option to fast forward to the end of a battle/round instead of hitting F cycling through all your guys just to let a retreating marksman ur not going to catch retreat. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I’m not asking for fast travel/teleport anywhere but some speed increases would be nice

They're not going to do that because of the whole *alcopops* issue. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Those things contain spirits but are mixed with sweet stuff so the alcohol content is relatively low.

I don’t think you understand how Newton’s laws work... for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, so the action of propelling the buckshot forward is equal to the recoil of the shotgun backwards, however we don’t notice recoil as much because the shotgun is way heavier than the buckshot, so it moves slower. Still buckshot is only going to hit them as hard as recoil to the chest. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ On an additional note, a projectile (buckshot for example) is really only encountering gravity and airresistance once it leaves the barrel, so putting the barrel of the shotgun to a steel plate isn’t going to do anything.

I'm not from the US, so I'm not into any partisan whataboutism, the same principles apply to any organisation.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ To reword the query: do the people of the US get *bang for buck* in terms of lost tax revenue by allowing these organisations to remain tax exempt simply on the basis that they are *charitable*? 
But everybody forgets his hiatus from Encore (Nov. 2004) to Relapse (May 2009).  Which is longer than the wait from MMLP2 (Nov. 2013) to Revival (Dec. 2017) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ And the only thing we got during the hiatus was The Re-Up.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ We got plenty from Em since MMLP2.  Shady XV, Southpaw Soundtrack, and his verses on Speedom, No Favors, Medicine Man, and Revenge.

When somebody is hired, they're not being set up for a promotion. They're being hired for one job. In the future, whomever decides to promote them holds the responsibility for placing them in a larger, potentially more destructive, role. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ In this case, Obama brought him into the FCC. Trump put him in charge.
He didn’t say “white people have it harder then minorities” people need to chill tf out, not everyone is trying to be racist/think they have worse problems then everyone else.  
Questionaires have codes to get through. For me, I answered everything as a for sure answer. Idr the options, but do not use the middle ones. Use the 5 or 1 for for sure or absolutely not. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Hopefully that makes sense.

Maria had gotten slightly drunk herself.  _back_to_line_ *If Jon's drunk why can't I be?*  _back_to_line_ Looking at Vivien's seat once more, she found it empty.  _back_to_line_ *Dammit. Where'd she go?* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *Jon, love, I'm going to get some fresh air.* She tossed the words casually at him, and, not waiting for a response, stood from her seat.  _back_to_line_ She wasn't lying when she said she needed fresh air. The hall smelled of wine, chicken, and a little sweat. It was a bit overwhelming for Maria.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ She sighed as the cool night air swept over her, a stark contrast to the warm and noisy environment inside. She heard somebody retching nearby and smiled to herself.  _back_to_line_ *If only that was Jon.*  _back_to_line_ Seeing a fountain across the gardens, Maria set a course for it, trying to walk as straight as possible.  _back_to_line_ *I'd never been one for wine.

It doesn't compile. it's basically a text editor with no syntax highlighting :). Not sure about the strict syntax part. The feedback I received didn't include any syntax errors. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ My tip is to read through all of the questions first. I answered them in order from easiest to most difficult and still had about 5 minutes left over. A basic understanding of data structures, algorithms, some built in libraries (I used Java), and debugging should push you through. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Let me know how it goes!

Nutrition: _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ - [Ripple](https://www.ripplefoods.com/original-unsweetened-plant-milk/) plant-based milk has a fat/protein profile similar to 2% cow's milk, with a bit less saturated fat. _back_to_line_ - Almond milk, cashew milk, coconut milk, and rice milk are not a substantial source of protein. This might be fine, depending on what else you're eating and how you're using it. _back_to_line_ - *Original* flavour is almost always a code word for *added sugar to make it taste more like cow's milk*. Similarly, chocolate and vanilla flavours are LOADED with sugar. I suggest trying the unsweetened version first, then switch to something else if you don't like it.  _back_to_line_ - Basically every major brand on the market is fortified with things like B12 and Vitamin D. That makes things easier. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ My opinions: _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ - Almond, cashew, and coconut milk work well as a carrier or accompaniment, like maybe you want something to put on your cereal or in your drink. I particularly like oats soaked in cashew milk. So luxurious! _back_to_line_ - [Silk Chocolate Soy milk](https://silk.com/products/chocolate-soymilk) is amazingly delicious. It totally hits the spot when you're hungry and thirsty after being active. But probably not a good idea to have every day. _back_to_line_ - Rice milk is kinda gross. _back_to_line_ - I haven't seen oat or hemp milk in stores around here, so I haven't tried either. _back_to_line_ - Drinks based on pea protein seem to have the widest possible audience. Some people want to avoid soy (??) and others have nut allergies. I've never met anyone who can't have peas. This can make a difference if you're preparing food for other people. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ TL;DR After discovering Ripple Unsweetened I just use that for everything.
Hey! Thanks for the offer but I'm looking for one in a bank ball.

No, it doesn't, and I just gave you the references - the StatsCan numbers do not lie. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Outhit, and you, are confusing a 14% decline in raw ride numbers  with a decrease in likelihood of people riding traffic. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Transit commuters grew more than twice as fast as car commuters, and the mode share of commuting to transit grew by about half a percent, the same amount that car drivers fell by. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It's a small amount, yes, but it is still an increase. Because the piece of the pie got bigger for the transit mode share, that means if you randomly queried people they would be slightly *more* likely to answer *Yes* to *Do you commute to work on the bus?*

We have a category of points called *Gen Points* that you award to your opponents. You can award these points opponents for any reason (you don't have to explain yourself) but they are intended to be used to reward sportsmanship &amp; good play. If that appeals to you, maybe add in 1 *gift point* you can award to an opponent, or a certain number of *gift points* to be given out over the course of the night.  _back_to_line_   _back_to_line_ Thanks for sharing your system &amp; definitely let us know what changes (if any) you adopt...

I'm gonna take a shit on the circle jerk but technically loot boxes are not gambling. To be gambling you have to place a monetary wager. If there is no wager there is no gambling. You cannot have a wager if there is no monetary value being exchanged. This is why skee ball is not gambling. This is why whack a mole is not gambling. This is why pinball is not gambling. This is why every card game and arcade game are not gambling. This is why wheel spinners are not gambling. This is why pokemon cards are not gambling. This is why magic the gathering is not gambling. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I hope you people realize that in the eyes of the law there is NO DIFFERENCE between buying CARD PACKS FOR MAGIC OR POKEMON and LOOT BOXES. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The government is not the solution for this problem and i don't think you people are aware of the side effects such a law is going to bring with it. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ But here's an idea that works. VOTE WITH YOUR MONEY AND LET CAPITALISM TAKE ITS COURSE. People will not continue to make games that don't make money. Games are first and foremost a BUSINESS. If a developer wants to put bullshit in their game that you don't like. That is their problem not yours. You do not have to buy their shit. There are already more games than you will ever be able to play. GO PLAY THE OTHER GAMES. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If you don't believe me subscribe to humble bundle for a year its about the cost of 1 AAA game and a season pass by the end of the year you will be completely inundated with more shit than you will ever know what to do with.

In the app, and online, you can see where the driver is.  You also get notified when the driver has marked your package as delivered.  I know it isn't the best system and some people do get a little weirded out when I'm dropping off packages, but they more than likely just ordered them and/or selected this two hour time for the package to be dropped off.  I'm not sure about the grocery delivery timeframe cause I have yet to purchase that for myself.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ What happened here is completely unprofessional and horrible for those of us that are actually going out there and being as kind and gentle with people's properties as possible.  I pride myself on being clean, professional, and respectful when I do this.  Partly because it's good money, but because it is the right thing to do whenever I interact with someone.  I'm going to get off my soapbox now.  Sorry :)
Which is fair, although I will say that S4 of The Flash is phasing back to acceptable levels and focusing more on camp and humor.
Why stop there? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Why can't we choose the ship in the loading screen, too? That way if I see the enemy taking a CV and more DDs, I can switch to a cruiser, or if they're taking cruisers to counter ours, I can take a BB to press delet)) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Also the upgrades and modernisations, those need to be swapped out some times. Having that accuracy mod is fun and fine, but sometimes I just want to dick the CV and take AA mods if I see one. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Also we should be able to spec our captain for each match, since they give some of the biggest boosts. I should be able to tell my captain that there's no point in hiding and to focus on secondaries and anti-air, or that he should prepare for firespam and prevent that shit. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ And we should be able to change ships after we die and respawn, that way we can adapt to what the enemy is fielding.

Everyone not super rich pays more. If you make more than half a million a year, this bill rocks. It also allows offshoring, capital gains preferred rate games, and more to continue, and kills the estate tax (only things that help the super rich), but takes away deducting your Scholarships or your mortgage interest and local property taxes. I pay about 18k a year in local and property tax, for instance, so I'll pay Federal taxes on that money now, as in my middle class taxes are going up at least a few thousand.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Since it increases the defecit by a large margin as well, it's going to trigger some automatic shutdowns of our healthcare system, and be ammo to gut more social programs.

I am happy with the laws, we are still able to have an opinion, express it and criticise religions and whatever else. You however seem unable to distinguish that from promoting hatred, intolerance or violence, which is what Britain First do.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Again, I have criticised both radical Islam and Britain First, you haven’t. I have said that they are both radical extremists, you haven’t. I’ve also pointed out to you that Britain First intimate* and have had members of its group sent to prison for inciting violence, something which you seem to blissfully or willingly ignore, so I can’t agree or accept that they are a peaceful organisation.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It is also naive to think that Britain First aren’t fundamentally Christian in parts of their outlook, I could comment on how all religion needs to be dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century and equally point out to you some ridiculous archaic rule written in a gospel, that is no longer relevant to today’s society. This is a wider problem than simply blaming Islam and it’s followers for everything. We as a society need to work at this stuff, pouting hatred and promoting fake news stories isn’t the way to go about this and doesn’t solve any of the issues, it only contributes further to it and widens the divides.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ This is why Trump was wrong to retweet these things. Fake news, retweeting fake news. He’s helped to give these extremists further exposure and (nearly ) make them seem legitimate in someway.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It follows that if you are willing to condemn Islam for being incompatible with western civilisation in its current form, you must also be prepared to condemn Britain First not being compatible with Britain in its current 21st century form. They hark back to time long gone.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Similarly I wish to leave this on a good note too, there are many good Christian’s and Muslims out there, who follow their faith and don’t agree with radical views, that means not supporting radical Islam and equally not supporting Britain First.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Nighty night.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Edit: *it should say intimidate not intimate- autocorrect got me :/

I've lived in London and I've met men in that situation actually, so it doesn't sound wrong to me. Pretty much exactly what op said. Some were homeless and said that they ended up on the streets after losing their job so I don't see how what you said makes any sense?Not to mention, the age for early disability is higher for men to.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ But not saying you're wrong,  just what I saw when I was there. Do you have a source for any of this? People laid off at 55 earn more,  and those with disability payments are given more? Which wouldn't change  the difference  in different disability pension age anyway.

Pssh, everyones got it wrong. Its all about waterboys.
&gt;the doctors said it started producing urine immediately after being translated _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Producing urine on the operating table just means you've successfully hooked all the tubes up. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I think part of your confusion comes from your understanding of how the kidneys work. Kidneys are basically glorified filters. Blood flows into them, some stuff gets filtered out as urine, and then the rest of that blood flows out the other side. As long as you get all your blood supplies hooked up and then link the new kidney to the bladder, it's gonna start making urine. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The kidneys **do** respond to chemical signals in the blood for adjustments, which they'll do regardless of whose body they're in -- but the recipient's body doesn't have to instruct the kidney to do anything.
You can make more by working while on EI. You deduct 50% of what you earn off your benefit rate and then get the rest. You don't make as much as you would for the work you do but when combining it with the EI it will be more.

The other things are SERIOUS systemic problems that require a total upheaval of society. People prefer to just ignore serious issues, it makes life easier.

Did EXTREMELY racist things that actually HURT minorities and made their lives harder. No one did a fucking thing. As soon as he said *black people* on tape everyone lost their minds.

If we make 2 out of 3 field goals against Washington we have a much better chance of winning that game. that would put us at 8-3, a huge difference than 7-4. The price of a game is easily millions. You're running back may fumble the ball occasionally statistically, but if one of those statistics was 3 in one game he'd be on the bench. Small mistakes don't impact winning and losing the same as big mistakes.

That entirely depends on what you're doing and how you manage your time. I myself am able to get all my stuff in order and put what's important first. Granted as much as I would love to sit down and play some Zelda for a few hours and just let the brain turn to mush I know I've got my college work as my priority.

He now identifies alleged underreported payments and accuses the defendants of failing to produce license agreements with Netflix and Apple so he can determine what's really owed.*
You should be a writer for elite dangerous. Some days I don't think they actually have full time staff dedicated to writing. I think they just bring a freelancer for a day, get them to write a few articles and logs and send them home for a month. Even if elite dangerous told the story through cutscenes like overwatch, I'd be chill with that. I think the main problem I have with 2.4s *story* is that fdev over hyped it and got all our expectations high. If they just told us that they were going to give you Thargoids and periodically release anti thargoid weapon types, at least it wouldn't be such a let down.

I started a small wall quilt a few months ago for a friend who totally redecorated her house and wanted new artwork. I have all the pieces cut, about half of them pieced, and for reasons I don't understand, I haven't been working on it. Instead I've started and finished a dozen other little projects while it languishes. I'd love to gift it to her for Christmas (very doable with weekend and evening sewing, and vacation beginning the 19th through the end of the year), but I'm not into it. What the hell is that about? I think it's too much pressure, since I designed it specifically for her. It's one thing to use a pattern and pick a fabric line, and another thing altogether to design a quilt from scratch to fit a specific person's preferences, I guess. I'm actually sort of stoked about it because I'm using wax prints and metallic fabrics, which are way outside of my wheelhouse, but I can't be moved to actually do the thing, it seems. Maybe I should choose an actual pattern and make that with my fabric scraps instead. (Do you see how I just decided to start another new project? This keeps happening. Send help.)

Yeah I don't quite get it either. I've tried again and again to get into this game but I don't know where to start, where to go or what to plan for. What's the point of building a massive factory if I'm going to have to dig the whole thing up because it just becomes too much like spaghetti and I can't expand it? Even if you make a bus system, how am I meant to know how much of everything to produce? How many science labs to build or how many green circuits to make? I just don't get it really.

I understand duty to act is a real thing, and people can have skewed perceptions and expect you to go beyond what is actually required by law and reasonable ethics.  That said, it sounds like you should be covered.  You said you feel like she is not an immediate threat to herself or others, you found her a safe place to stay, and have made efforts to get her appropriate help.  That should be enough to meet any ethical obligations.  The only thing I can obviously see maybe doing differently is asking DH to call 911 if she shows up bleeding at your house again. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ More importantly, you have a right to protect yourself.  Calling constantly, showing up at your house uninvited and unwelcome is pretty blatant harassment, and honestly at some point you just need to protect yourself from that.  Take a step back from the situation; what sort of advice would you give a client who was being harassed like this? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Also, regarding blocking her from a healthcare facility:. It absolutely can be and is done.  I'm very familiar with many individuals who have been prohibited from returning to a hospitals for a variety of reasons.  There are legal/ethical hurdles involved obviously, but it certainly is an option.

Fhwooo. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Hello there.  First time poster, long time penis haver.  I follow this sub because my wife is due in May, which is a miracle.  I say that because I have viable sperm, but we didn't think we could get pregnant, because I had major problems with my penis, including balanitis, reoccuring UTIs, retrograde ejaculation and priapisms, all of which resulted in sex often being unrewarding if not extremely painful for me. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ These issues and others had been a significant burden to me throughout my life, and all of them were related in no small part to not being circumcised.  My insecurity and denial meant it took a very long time before I had the courage to take action to sort things out as an adult.  A few months before I turned 30, I finally went through with a circumcision, hoping that it would improve our sex life and improve our fertility chances.  The surgery did achieve both these goals, and I'm able to function normally now.  However, there were significant obstacles to get to where I am now.  Because the skin was so tight against my gland, the surgery took longer than my urologist predicted, and the anesthetic wore off.  Since we were about two thirds through the procedure when I started gaining sensation, I had to lie down as still as possible and feel the skin being cut and stitched, and smell the bloody wounds being cauterized.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I was able to walk away from the operation and attend to my responsibilities, but my penis was left in an extremely sensitive state for several months, as in it felt like I was being stabbed in the head of my cock with a pen if I made a stride too long and my penis brushed against my jeans through my underwear.  God forbid if I had an erotic dream and had an erection, because I would wake up screaming and sometimes have to vomit from the pain.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ This experience also was hell on my relationship with my mother, who I grew to resent for her decision which went against the medical advise she had received at the time. I also wasn't myself for a time - my personality became very negative while I was recovering, and I would lash out at friends, family members and even my spouse when the pain was too much and I'd ran out of patience with them.  That is perhaps my greatest personal regret, I hurt a lot of people emotionally because I was hurting physically, and there are a lot of bridges burned from that time in my life. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I wouldn't wish any aspect of this experience upon my worst enemy, and especially not on my newborn son.  I sincerely hope you will reconsider this doctor's advice.
But that doesn't mesh well with his talking points.
&gt; In most fights that I've used Ayaka, she spends a significant amount of time doing nothing. Eiko always does something useful and can keep your party alive regardless. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ what does eiko do that's so useful, really? there's only 2 things that eiko can do that ayaka can't: fill the esper gauge and remove debuffs (one at a time). on non-clutch turns, i'd much rather spend time putting reraise on the team than filling the esper gauge. and if you need to remove debuffs every turn then just bring a stat debuff resist? otherwise eiko will be locked into trying to remove debuffs and has no time for her esper gauge filling or healing. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; having the option to bubble your tank in provoke/cover heavy fights (most new content) is also very good. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ you keep on talking about the bubble as if it's the most amazing thing in the world. it only adds 2k hp. if you want to talk about  *effective hp* then you have to consider that reraise adds effectively another 80% of a unit's hp. sure they lose all their buffs/etc, but is 2k hp + buffs more than +80% hp? i'm skeptical but you do the math.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ the moment they bring back a *no death* achievement, then that's when i'd prefer a bubble over a reraise. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ also there's nothing *new* about the current new content. it's just a matter of having a dodge tank cover/provoke or a mag cover tank with the appropriate resists. there would still be mechanics that would just straight up kill you/your team that the tank can't do anything about, and that's where reraise comes in handy. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; You do bring up a very good point here in that Eiko lacks flexibility that DC provides which I would say is her biggest weakness. If you're fighting a boss which is very dispel or reraise heavy then, yes, perhaps you should consider not using Eiko for it, or using her with other units to provide either backup heals or utility _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ but that's my whole point -.-  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ and being able to do 2 things a turn *really well* makes a world of difference. that's why ayaka is objectively better as tilith *as a healer* even when tilith even has more utility (resist buffs, stat debuff resistance, all stat buff) AND can guarantee an aoe full heal (ayaka can't - maybe she'll fall short when the units hps are north of 15k?) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ if i fail a trial/fight because i don't have enough healing, i'd go to ayaka. if i fail a trial/fight because i lack a summoner, i'd go to eiko. problem is, there are very few fights where i wish i had a better summoner. hell many times i even prefer to bring garnet for summoning achievements because she can aoe all res buff _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ you keep on arguing she's *good enough* for the *content*. all i'm saying is she's *not a great healer* using ayaka/cg fina as a benchmark of a *great healer*. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ /shrugs
Hey there and welcome! There are many many different facets to this deck. It is very deceiving in that way.

Nope you can't, though may be of at least some comfort to know that to be on most transplant lists at most transplant centers you have to have abstained from vices like smoking, drinking, etc for a period of at least 6 months. In some states you *can* dictate how your body is donated (whether for medical research, medical education, or organ donation) but generally not past that.   _back_to_line_    _back_to_line_  Also even though you've checked the box to be an organ, there are a lot more hoops to jump through before you could say with 100% certainty that someone will end up with your kidney. First you'd have to die, then you'd have to die while relatively healthy (i.e. not be an 85 year old with heart failure and high blood pressure), then the manner in which you died would have to preserve the function of organs being donated (can't donate a kidney that was crushed in a car wreck, if you die from blood loss and your organs start to die before they are harvested they'll be no bueno), then your family/next of kin would have to either affirm that they want to donate your body and/or not object to your body being donated.

He said he was new and looking to improve in the round prior. After ~~I rekt him~~ this I told him that to be fair, Varesh is one of the hardest champs in the game to learn, but stick with it and he can eventually do what I did to him. Everyone said gg at the end of the game, including him. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ What I'm trying to say is that the vibe wasn't salty so I truely hope I didn't scare him off. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 
They 100% would be against this as well. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 1. Tinker v. DesMoines. Supreme Court case where students who wore black armbands had to appeal all the way to SCOTUS because the government wanted *that badly* to prevent them from wearing something that signified protest. This country has a rich  history of suppressing peaceful protest.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 2. When Tommie Smith and John Carlos [raised a fist at the Olympics](https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_960w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/08/31/Interactivity/Images/AP_162146978510981472659752.jpg&amp;w=480), they did it for a reason. It wasn't just *black right* or *black power.* The International Olympic Committee protected apartheid countries like South Africa and Rhodesia, didn’t hire black officials, and was led by a man, a white supremacist named Avery Brundage, who fought hard to include the Nazis in the Olympics in the 1930s but was against black civil rights (and later [chose to send Tommie and John home](https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/avery-brundages-complicated-olympic-legacy) for raising a fist). He literally released a statement later defending allowing the Nazi salute and allowing Nazi Germany to participate in the games but banning Smith and Carlos for the raised fist. So of course, America goes along with it, and [friendly ESPN personality Brent Musburger](https://d1ynl4hb5mx7r8.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/12101059/Brent-Musburger.jpg) wrote a column calling them *black-skinned stormtroopers* without realizing the fucking irony in calling athletes Nazis for silently protesting racism and Naziism at the games. Apparently wearing a black glove for civil rights is more Nazi than supporting Nazis and apartheid. And so the dialogue gets muddled, and now no one remembers that they were dealing with or expelled by a Nazi sympathizer. It's just divisive *black power.* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 3. Plenty of people have been wearing BLM regalia at protests. A lawyer wore it in court [and a judge made her remove it](http://nairalaw.com/index.php/tort-articles/2-uncategorised/14242-should-lawyers-wear-black-lives-matter-pins-in-court) (despite the fact that she was representing a white defendant). NFL and NBA players wore *I can't breathe* t-shirts after cops killed Eric Garner and of course people said the league should fine them. In fact the NBA Commissioner **said the exact same thing** every milquetoast *moderate* has said about every other form of black protest, including the redditor above - saying *I respect Derrick Rose and all of our players for voicing their personal views on important issues, but my preference would be for players to abide by our on-court attire rules.* And when the topic came up again this year w/r/t kneeling, he said *One of the core principles of this country is freedom of expression. Given the platform that they have, whether it's the regular engagement they have with the media, whether it's social media, whether it's other opportunities they have to work in the communities, they have those opportunities for their voices to be heard.* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 4. For the record, NFL players don't wear t-shirts or armbands because the league prohibits them - they don't like that form of protest either. Which is one of the reasons why players started taking a knee - someone had already told them to *find another way to protest.* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ As you said - no matter what, there will always be *moderates* who don't want anyone to protest will always move the goalposts. Do A and they say *Don't do that, it's too divisive, I don't get why you just don't do B*. Next year do B and they say *It's disrespectful to the military, you should be fired, why don't you do A*. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ In the end, the message comes down to a subtle way of saying *I don't want you to protest at all.*
I think you should try hashing things out with the roommate. You're *not* actually sharing the room with your roommate + her mom, you're sharing the room with your roommate. Set it up as a conversation on how often you're both ok with having people over: you'd be a shitty roommate if you had your friends over every single day, she's being a shitty roommate by having her mom over every day. It's a communal area. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If that doesn't go anywhere, contact your RA about switching rooms, and if that doesn't go anywhere contact their superior. If none of the polite or *legal* stuff works, it's time to start bringing the friends who play loud and aggressive punk music over, with their loudest speakers. But do try the adult approaches before switching to passive-aggressive attempts to smoke them out.

Yes fiddling around with the token.txt file is the tricky bit, but immensely satsfying if you crack it. If you use something like %1,9a it will try all lowercase letters up to 9 characters in length and that used to crash my machine. Use the wildcards sparingly. Im nkt sure what you mean by *6down, 7down* but %A is wildcard for capital %a lowercase and %n for letters and numbers. %P tries pretty much any symbol on the key board. Good luck using that beyond 6 characters though! _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Bear in mind you really need to have a good idea of most of the characters in a 13 character password.

Holy shit you did again! Wow! I wish more people were exposed to what you are saying! This is crossing my mind right now: people assume that they have a right to spend as less money as possible on a game because it goes against everything they've ever heard, but the truth is that you're using someone else's service, and if it's good enough (Like Clash Royale) then they're in every right to implement micro transactions. Dude, I want to thank you for taking me seriously as well in towards the end of our dialogue. I'm a bit mind blown from your perspective to be honest. Are you s developer or something?

The main issue I've seen here is people who were charged for a month shortly after converting; they were expecting to be charged for a year.

Or maybe he was but the backtrack was so darn loud he may as well not have. He sounded like a robot. He's only got a few lines and he's practically standing still when he sings them. There's no excuse to not perform live. All the other vocalists performed live (or with only quiet backtrack) except during difficult dance moves.

I'll acknowledge it not being double standards if you can get me a review that lists a con of a game being too western. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Edit: That's not a valid excuse either. You're excusing people for being culturally ignorant. Why is it that other countries can understand the mores and norms of western culture but for Japanese culture, they can't?

I second on the online friends choice.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ And as someone who also suffers from anxiety: be patient. You are young, I am not much older, I had your age very little time ago and I used to lose so much time thinking about things that were out of my grasp... You have so much time and still so little to worry about, take your time to study, read as much as you can, learn new things, start learning things that you will use on your professional or academic life, play games, work on yourself and make plans for the future. If you can't fit with the people around you, forget it and remember that in two years time you will leave and have a world of possibilities in your hands. Time will go by faster than you will notice.
Didn't some football manager have that God-awful Michael Jackson statue? I mean, even if you don't believe the rumours, it's still scary enough to tear down..
&gt; I liked the characters, but didn't always completely get them. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ This is actually my favorite part of the game. Most developers baulk at the notion of giving you a protagonist that you might not completely relate to 100% because it risks breaking your 'immersion'. Night in the Woods gives you a fairly divisive protagonist that not everyone is going to be able to relate to, and then challenges you to _try_ to relate (or at least to understand) her. It asks you to be open minded and think about why people act the way they do. The 'big reveal' at the end of the game just drives the point home that you really never know what other people are going through [spoiler](#s *even if you've been playing as them for the whole game*).

It's clear that we aren't going to agree, other than to agree to disagree. However I will say that if you take the 10 commandments and compare them to the pillars of Islam, Islam comes out looking rather more progressive. I think as.you said that there are Muslims who take it a la carté just as Christians do, and I suspect that most of.your objections stem from things that are mostly cultural and not religious. If you really think Christians are less bad than Muslims then you're ignoring 2000 years of massacre and oppression.

For example, games like Command and Conquer, Doom, Resident Evil, Street Fighter 2, Gran Turismo and Super Mario Bros 3. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Now, the games that sell the most copies and have the biggest production values tend to be the ones that are mostly the same as previous games ie Assassin's Creed, GTA and CoD.  Innovation and new mechanics tend to come from smaller projects or indie games.

The morality choices in that game don't matter that much. Yeah, it ends up making you choose a type of conversation option...but not every choice you make is just about the paragon/renegade axis. Sometimes you're choosing how to resolve certain quests with unforseeable consequences that can doom races or alienate party members. I also found the universe/lore pretty interesting. It's one of the best modern RPGs to come out and I think you're doing yourself a big disservice if you're skipping it without at least trying it.

From the [*Reviews* section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagarism#Reviews) of the book on the Wikipedia page it seems that this hypothesis is more of a fringe theory and not really accepted by most scholars. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Either way, the early history of Islam and the life history of Muhammad is, with few exceptions, not romanticized at all; it is common knowledge that he was an illiterate man of extremely impoverished background and that his preaching wasn't really taken seriously by most people during his early days, there was so much in there that could be used to cast an negative view on Muhammed (raiding, pillaging, torture, genocide, child brides, etc...). It doesn't really feel like an unrealistic or heroic story, as most mythicized religious origin stories go. It doesn't seem made up at all (except for the parts about being handled the Quran by Gabriel himself and stuff like that, of course).

Yeah, I went through almost as bad, and personally witnessed far far worse. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Honestly, I didn't really have a concept that people had lives that lacked this kind of thing for years; I always thought a lot of TV shows depicting high schools with happy children were nothing but some kind of 'it'd be really nice if' fantasy, but I learned in adulthood that apparently people *really do* experience what to me looked like fairy-tale childhoods.
Maybe you're trying to focus on to many things at once, i tried doing multiple things at once a few years back and ended up having a mental breakdown and receding completely from the outside world. Now i'm slowly working through one thing at a time, occasionally i feel like i can't do it anymore but i force myself to and i always feel so much better after doing it. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ So i'd say make 1 short term goal and get to it, maintain it then set another short term eventually you'll be maintaining a healthier life and it all works towards long term goals you may or may not even have. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ That said it is incredibly difficult to push through these thoughts and professional help is always advisable.

First of all, I am so sorry for your loss. People say *you will heal in time* but the truth is, it will always hurt. It's just that some days more than others.... for longer or lesser periods. I know this may sound silly, but do you have a pet? If not, you should really looking in to getting a dog (I'd recommend Boston Terrier!) dogs are amazing, they have this wonderful ability to cheers us up when we feel awful.   You should also check out meetup.com, they have lots of neat *meet ups* for different hobbies and interests. You are going to have to just put yourself out there at some point, and it's not going to be easy. I lost my best friend , my little sister- she was only 25- a little over a month ago. While our losses aren't the same, I do empathize with you and can certainly relate to some of what you are experiencing. Try to take everything one baby step at a time. You need to focus on your health , because if you aren't healthy you won't be able to accomplish these things. Feel free to message me if you want to chat. :)

You keep asking for the same thing but I don't hear what you give. I only hear why what you take is nothing. Well it is not nothing. You just want it for nothing.

I have to say I am seeing that you will forever ask for more than fair. You don't even want to discuss what is fair. For me it is a big reason we have no solution. And very big reason for good relationships. To be fair.

Yes, I've friends in California &amp; they spot these apex predators quite often &amp; in the evening...they're nocturnal hunters for the most part, most active at dusk &amp; dawn. I've only ever seen one once, in person &amp; that was in the Colorado Rockies many years ago. Best sighting story I have was shared by my cousin in Kansas. He works at a bank in a college town in the eastern part of the state. Several years ago, he sent me a video from his bank's security camera. There, walking past the ATM, was a gorgeous mountain lion, bold as day. Stared right into the camera a few seconds. It was a handful of years later that the DNR in the state of Kansas confirmed breeding pairs in the state once again after roughly 110 years. Plenty of big, grain fed deer out there to support them.
First the disclaimer: You should use your own defense or ideas if they work for you better. We all have different heroes it seems, I know I do, so I understand it why you would also go with different defenses with the different heroes you have. My own experience when [raiding in Guild Wars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlTWhvOxrno&amp;index=35&amp;list=PLEsW9tt-Mb63Hrbhffz9acgpj1BIvyYaz) it's that a lot of different defenses may work surprisingly well, at least against me. So use whatever floats your boat! :-) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I had posted an earlier version of this defense to this sub before. I had predicted that I would change it as needed. And I did change it since then. But for the past month it has remained the same and proved itself against all those Guild Wars since. The results are that on average they will get one or two successful attacks against me in a Guild Wars, with most of them being under 100%. It used to be that players with less than 100k might would defeat me in Guild Wars, but it has been more rare since. Nowadays if they get a successful attack they often have over 100k might at least. :-) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I would say that they are most often successful when using a combination of head-to-head heroes. I don't have Gunslinger yet so I'm not too scary a target at all. I'm not one of the top targets in my guild even, although without super heroes like the Gunslinger I would say that I'm up there. I just checked and I'm currently top 9 in might in my guild. Today I got attacked 7 times and they didn't defeat me yet. Last Guild Wars they attacked me over 17 times and didn't defeat me a single time either. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I have in the past posted a defense for HBM and it was a good defense that helped me to clear all the way to AE. It helped others. Something cool was coming across that defense while doing some normal raids. I was surprised the other day when I faced a familiar defense. :-) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ That is the intent. To help others. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ With this defense, I don't have to switch defenses to farm Hero Trials L16. But it is not good for L17, unless you have heroes like Gunslinger. :-) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The totems have Aries and Valentina. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Heroes are Skull Knight, Grimfiend, Ghoulem, Michael up front. Dread Drake and Vlad Dracula in the back. If I had Gunslinger, it would perhaps replace Vlad first. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The army camps in the back are fairly well-protected. Their units aren't easily baited and the heroes nearby help to cover them. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The walls aren't breached by Hero Trials.

This type of immigrant scaring isn't new, in Australia in the 1970's the talk was of the *asian invasion*. They thought they would segregate themselves from the rest of the cities and begin to take over governmental roles. It didn't happen, instead they started small businesses and added to the economy, they have become one of the main characteristics of Sydney and Melbourne. Don't give in to propaganda, because it isn't nuanced or based in fact, influx of immigrants has never led to a significant change in cultural norms, and in many cases it's far more dangerous for those immigrants than the residents who reject them.

Most occupations do not have armed resistance on a massive scale. There was a massive civil war going on (that Syria itself played a massive role in worsening). What resistance do you expect when everyone fighting was fighting each other? Even with that, there was still resistance against the Syrian forces but not much can be done against a massive force especially in a small and unmilitarized country like Lebanon. And in Iraq, most of the efforts by militant groups was targeting civilians and Iraqi forces first, Coalition forces second if you want to talk about who they were fighting against. Not to mention the whole scenario was entirely different. Also Syria was in Lebanon right after the civil war started to take advantage of the situation and was doing the opposite of trying to create order, so it's wrong to say they only entered *after* the civil war. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Even disregarding the incorrect points, I guess that's one convoluted way to excuse aggression especially since Lebanon was doing absolutely nothing to warrant it.

[Mirrlees Review](https://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/mirrleesreview/design/ch16.pdf):  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;Housing can be thought of as a large consumer durable, like a very big fridge _back_to_line_ or car. When considering the taxation of most consumer durables, we start _back_to_line_ from the presumption that it would be appropriate to impose VAT on their _back_to_line_ price when new. This is because the price of the durable itself reflects the _back_to_line_ present value of the stream of services it is expected to yield. VAT paid on _back_to_line_ the newly bought good is, in effect, a prepayment on the stream of services _back_to_line_ yielded. A natural starting point is that the same approach should be applied  _back_to_line_ to housing. Yet, at present, the UK, alone among OECD countries, applies a _back_to_line_ zero rate of VAT to the construction and sale of residential property.14 _back_to_line_ Houses differ from other consumer durables not only in size. For one _back_to_line_ thing, they last a very long time—hundreds of years in many cases. This _back_to_line_ raises two possible difficulties for imposing VAT. _back_to_line_ &gt; _back_to_line_ First, because houses are so long lived, their consumption value may _back_to_line_ change a great deal over time. Hence, their up-front price may prove to be a _back_to_line_ bad approximation to the value of consumption services they eventually _back_to_line_ provide. Ideally, if a house delivered more (less) valuable services than was _back_to_line_ originally envisaged and built into the purchase price, we would like to tax _back_to_line_ (subsidize) this difference. This is true in principle for all durables, but on a _back_to_line_ much larger scale for housing. _back_to_line_ &gt; _back_to_line_ Second, even if we wanted to impose VAT on newly built housing, we _back_to_line_ would still fail to impose any tax on the majority of UK housing for many _back_to_line_ decades to come. Taxing newly built housing while failing to tax the stream _back_to_line_ of consumption services that existing housing continued to provide would _back_to_line_ be problematic. It would artificially encourage overuse of existing properties _back_to_line_ and discourage new construction, while forgoing revenue from the existing _back_to_line_ housing stock means giving windfall gains to current homeowners at the _back_to_line_ expense of non-owners. An alternative15 would be to levy VAT both on _back_to_line_ newbuild and on existing properties the next time they are sold—taxing the _back_to_line_ stream of consumption services they are expected to yield thereafter without _back_to_line_ retrospectively taxing the consumption services enjoyed to date. But this _back_to_line_ would act to discourage mutually beneficial transactions as people sought to _back_to_line_ defer the tax16 and has the potential, like a planning gains tax, to be avoided _back_to_line_ altogether by the simple expedient of waiting for a future government to _back_to_line_ repeal the tax, before entering into any transaction. _back_to_line_ &gt; _back_to_line_ If we want to tax the consumption value of housing, therefore, it is _back_to_line_ probably best to do so at the point at which the services are consumed rather _back_to_line_ 14 Since VAT is generally charged on refurbishing existing properties but not on building new _back_to_line_ ones, the current system also incentivizes developers to build new properties rather than _back_to_line_ redevelop derelict sites. 15 Proposed by Crawford, Keen, and Smith (2010). 16 Another way of thinking about this effect is that, since only housing services consumed after _back_to_line_ the next transaction would be taxed, the tax would be minimized by delaying a transaction as _back_to_line_ long as possible.  _back_to_line_ than at the point of first purchase. That suggests an annual tax related to the _back_to_line_ (consumption) value of the property. _back_to_line_ &gt; _back_to_line_ One immediate point to note is that such a tax should not be levied on _back_to_line_ any increase in property value resulting from improvements on which VAT _back_to_line_ has been levied. To do so would involve double taxation. This could, in _back_to_line_ principle, be avoided either by zero-rating such expenditure—spending on _back_to_line_ constructing extensions, for example—or by taxing only the consumption _back_to_line_ value of the ‘unimproved’ property. This latter solution seems wholly _back_to_line_ impractical over the long run. It would be odd indeed to be charging tax on a _back_to_line_ property in 2050 on the basis of its condition in 2010, for example. The _back_to_line_ former solution—not charging VAT on improvements—is preferable: the _back_to_line_ guiding principle should be that only those kinds of improvements that will _back_to_line_ affect the property valuation should be zero rated (or, in other words, _back_to_line_ valuations should only take account of improvements that were zero rated). _back_to_line_ Nevertheless, it may be difficult to define and police qualifying _back_to_line_ improvements in practice. This may be an area in which we have to accept _back_to_line_ some imperfection in the system.  _back_to_line_

This is entirely true. My friend has a guy come clean her house twice a month or so, completely free. He just has to be naked and she has to be mean to him while he does it. Best deal ever for her, and I get the sense he's stoked about it as well (I've been there a couple times, with his consent).
The big difference here is the not speaking part. We get a ton of talking from Lore and Binder without getting any personality. I'd be much more forgiving of the Heartbound demo if characters with no personality didn't speak so much.

Actually, I can ID anyone I want to. If I have a question about your age, I can ID you. You may be 50, but if you look maybe 30, you'll still get carded. The penalties or too steep for making a mistake (fine for me, the store, and then there's that pesky 18 months in prison part). There's no reason to get pissy about being ID'd. I'm in my 40s and when I go to buy anything age restricted, I have my ID out. There's no big deal.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The policy of *under 30* is just to give you a heads up. Since someone where I work got busted for failing to card, our policy is under 50 right now. Stings happen frequently around the holidays.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Bottom line: they are just doing their job. If I had a choice, I'd ID only the 25 and under crowd, and never twice if I recognized you, because I sure as hell don't need anyone's fucking attitude just for asking for ID. So give your cashiers and servers a break please. 
Idk man all these documentaries about HP get it all wrong in my opinion. They always talk about the MAgIC THE MAGIC it's MAgiCLA behind THEMAGIC OF HARRYPOTTER. Harry Potter was so popular because of the characters. Their qualities, interactions and challenges they face.

Bundling can work a few ways, the way you described, also known as Cable TV (I only want 12 channels but i'm going to pay for 1200).  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Or, you can bundle based on value.  High value (new release) heroes/skins bundled with older heroes/skins.  The new releases retain their standalone value, and the older items are discounted.  It's then seen as incremental.  *I was going to buy this hero anyway, and now i get added value in that!*  They're just further incentivizing the original purchase.  I think this is what Blizz is doing.  Maybe you personally don't value the other items, but it seems they're building bundles this way.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The last way i'm aware of, and i hope Blizz adds, is a Flex Bundle.  you create your own bundle and a larger discount is applied based on the number of items you add.

Thanks for the opinion.. I've been seeing a psychologist for a while and she'd actually mentioned that it's a pretty common issue in marriages (secret or not). I do think I could get past the lies and have a bright future together but only if he stops 100% of it and fully commits (which I frankly don't think will happen, at least not in the near future). Then again, I imagine us having a child, and that changes the dynamic of my thought process completely. If he'd do this while I were pregnant or with a baby, I'd probably flip out and roll his car down a cliff or something...

Yes.

From the launch you solved for the constant because PE=0. At the peak, v=0 so KE=0. So by conservation of energy all the energy is PE. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ That allows you to make the equations equal.

No amount of max block size would support all the world's future transactions on the main blockchain. I am not in opposition to increasing blocksize, and I don't think that most people are against a increase to 8Mb as Bitcoin Cash has done but by doing so now you delay the inevitable second layer solutions to a time when they will be much more difficult to implement. Bitcoin Cash may see a temporary improvement due to it's larger blocks but the foresight of the second layer solutions that are now being developed for Bitcoin will dominate in the long run.

They are limited in how much they can cut Medicare and SS each year, so it will be a slow bleed. But sure, i imagine if this keeps up, eventually they will just cancel the programs and payments altogether.

Shouldnt be crazy big, but substantial. Its that the calculations can be quite elaborate once one starts going into that path unless ur into chance calculation, but thats been a while for me. XD.

Each path then also has the same for wether or not patches was in the opener.

So she grew up in an atmosphere to trust decision from above. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ What happens? „Mimimi the Admirals are overreacting/panicking after endor. Better betray all I lived for and start killing imperials“ ... _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ But yeah, also the behavior of the admiral etc. seems so .. wrong &amp; simple.. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ In the old canon the empire mostly broke down because they couldn’t agree on a leader + fought each other. Here? They seem to hold together and instead of following Tarkins doctrine (Control through fear of power/violence . Not power/violence itself) they start masacratring planets for no reason... _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ And that’s now canon?...
Navy is more relevant than Tennessee now. And the sacrifice those kids make to play at Navy cannot be overstated. As a football program and institution, Navy represents principles its alumni, fans, and all Americans should be proud of. Tennessee is an embarrassment to itself and a national laughingstock.

&gt;Considering the military has never once defeated a guerilla insurgency I disagree. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ We defeated the insurgency in Iraq and installed a puppet government. Israel defeated the Insurgency in Palestine and subjugated the population. The Russians have defeated the Chechens and are just about finished with defeating ISIS. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;Also our army wouldn't be to keen on killing its own citizens. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Sure they would. They already have. Remember Kent State? Remember Obama targeting and killing American citizens with drones? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The army obeys orders. Also a huge majority of the Army are religious fundamentalists and extremist right wing ideologues. All you have to tell a soldier is that a person is a liberal or an atheist or a muslim and they would be happy to line them up against a wall and mow them down. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;, would you support the same restrictions on voting which has led to the deaths of millions more then guns. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Since I an not a complete idiot who is unable to think or reason I don't believe that voting has led to the deaths of millions of people.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I realize that you on the other hand are not capable of higher order reasoning so you think that. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Oh and nothing I said would actually restrict your ability to own a gun.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ That's the other bit of insanity on the table.

Oddly enough, as OP as they are, much like Ahsoka, it doesn't take much to stop them. If you can drop anything in front of your turret before they lock on, you can get them dead pretty easy.

You assume people in those situations make logical decisions. That they're always capable of reason in response to trauma.

Honestly, I should put an asterisk on that, because I'm assuming some orientations because they haven't been stated explicitly, but it's between: _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ - Clinton, who's apparently straight and into Brunhilde _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ - Brunhilde, who... well, there's an amount of who-the-hell-knows here, because Brun's Brun, but she could be bisexual, asexual, asexual but heteroromantic, just full ace and this is where we go down fractal rabbit hole... _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ - Elliot, who'd definitely into Brun and has hinted that he's bisexual and attracted to Clinton _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ So, it's a probably-straight man, a definitely-bi man and a question mark they're both chasing (with some one way unrequited attraction going a different way). _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ ........point's just, the relationship diagrams for this comic get *weird*...

I am following the Chinese sword market and have a good collection going. The only place I saw that was SBG. I think that is Paul maybe - maybe - hyping things up a bit. There's no 'alert' like this on Seven Stars Trading Co., Ryan Swords, or anywhere else. So I don't expect buying Chinese jian / gim or dao, etc., to become impossible for anyone in the US/UK/Europe anytime soon to the point that justifies SBG saying:if you want to get something order NOW before it's too late!

No. It was around 2013 and foreigners were buying up everything. He denied it completely and called you racist if you mentioned it.

I am broadly in agreement with that, but what happens when your business is intended primarily to serve people of the same religious background as yourself? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ For example, can a kosher or halal business refuse a request for a food item that doesn't fit within the guidelines? Can a Christian bookshop refuse to order in a copy of the Quran?
The fact that Mace isn't in this picture makes me sad.
In real life, guys I'm generally attracted to aren't attracted to me. I'm average looking and kinda overweight. Guys who are attracted to me generally don't interest me, for a myriad of reasons.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ So, yeah, if my goal was just to have sex for the sake of sex, no matter what, I would have my pick of the crowd. Just any guy who walks up and talks to me should be good. But (1) it doesn't take in account for the *stranger danger* and *victim blaming* dilemma, (2) it doesn't take in account for my need to feel both physical attraction and emotional connection before me wanting to have sex with someone and (3) it doesn't take in account that I *might* want to climax and one-night stands with randos don't do it for me.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ When these male Redditors say that it's easier for women to get sex, it would be if we were to completely disregard our own desires and standards. Similarly, guys who go out with only the idea of sex in mind would get as lucky as they think women are if they weren't looking for Scarlett Johansson or Rihanna.

Genuinely curious as to which reasons you feel are BS - or are you saying the reasons are right, but the premise that those are the reasons is BS?  As someone who is pretty familiar with the pfSense code and development model from the time period prior to the fork, I don't find fault in the technical, security, or quality arguments.  I stopped following pfSense as closely after I stopped contributing so I can't comment on the community or transparency arguments.  Don't care for, or about the OPNSense/pfSense drama, don't have time or energy to invest in that worthless discussion.

The WAU has already stolen scans of a sizeable chunk of the station, if not all of them. It had been stealing brain scans from Pilot Seats since the comet hit, a year before the game even starts. Having access to the ARK is meaningless for the WAU. Plus, the ARK was only made possible because of Chun's research on the Vivarium, which was created by the WAU in the first place. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Launching the ARK means the remnants of humanity get to have thousands of years of living in a virtual utopia. All of those people on the ARK would still prefer that to the alternative. Even with the WAU's progression, Earth's surface will be barren and lifeless for a long, long time.

Can kinda depend on your class and current level. From my experience, the early dungeons of an expansion are terrible exp (mainly the 51 and 61 dungeons.) and deep dungeon, pvp, or squadron can be better. It really depends on whether you want to enjoy the game. If you like sidequests, there's a ton but they are *VERY* low exp sadly. A very good way to supplement exp is doing kojin beast tribe dailies every day.
For my own personal benefit, could you please expand on the issues you found in the Plan of Salvation (or Plan of Happiness, or Plan of No Regrets, or whatever they’re calling it this week) that you mentioned in your post?  NOM-ish/TBM-ish DW still clings to that bit of theory since there’s not much else in the church that has any redeeming qualities.  She clings to the Plan o’ Salvation, and her feels.  It always about the feels... _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ BTW, I’ve been in this turd bucket of a church for 47 years, and just noticed today that the Plan of Salvation = “POS”.  Hah!
The other comment answers your questions very well, but just to latch onto that comment and add two things. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Paraphrasing, they stated that your fees are lower [with an etf], but I believe that was understated. If you are day trading you are incurring large amounts of commissions and/or trade fees as well as realizing short term gains which means taxes. And not just any taxes, short term gains taxes. yuck. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ By long term investing with an ETF you buy, hold (assuming longer than 1 year) and only pay long term taxes. Oh and you may pay a dividend tax if your etf(s) pay dividends. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ And my second point: the 5-10% a day is a bit misleading too. The only real way to make day trading profitable for an individual trader (to offset commissions, fees, and potential taxes) is to trade on margin. Margin can cost you big time as well as nuke you down if you make a large trade that goes sideways. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It is not uncommon to hear of people who thought they could day trade and lost their homes as a result.

What do you mean by training? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Having a good ear is everything like the others already said. There are multiple ways to tune your ears though; imo, seeking out the sounds that you like and want to hear on the fretboard is the best form of ear training. By kind of forcing it while playing your whole body comes to recognize things and you naturally become more creative on the instrument.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;is it something that guitarists should always attempt to improve? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ By doing what I said above, you basically cant ever stop improving; there's just too many possible combinations to go through. So I would say rather than spend too much time listening to intervals and stuff, just play what you want to retain well.  _back_to_line_

Are you just  naturally quiet and nervous around people? If so its likely you are just shy.

In the beam of light you can see a figure saying *oh no* which is a reference to another comic strip. I wish I knew the name of it because it's really funny. 
Was going to add you but then saw you were 96.  I'm 6 :(
Maybe time for a new mattress?
Well yeah sure, but it's not a problem that affects /u/dcman00000 directly, so it must not exist. More importantly, he's too educated and knowledgable to have an agenda, so you just have to trust him when he says it's not a problem.
Raising consciousness is the first step, the next is organisation.
Got these two finished kits in today. They look great. Every so slight damage during shipping on some tiny parts that I'm going to look into repairing, but nothing too bad.

The Nets turning their sub into a movie sub was my favorite.
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick &amp; Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂 _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick &amp; Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎
Do you have access to public transportation in your area?   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ What specifically do you consult on?  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Where are you?   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Businesses breaking even implies you’ve sunk money into them.  How much have you invested in them and remember you aren’t making a profit until you’ve surpassed your initial investment.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_

Some airlines do make you buy another seat if you can't fit in one, but this was the day before Thanksgiving. I didn't want somebody not to be able to see their family because they're too fat.
Honestly same here and I’m just looking for the halo or would you do black magic missle jager burnt sienna grims burnt sienna gp tw witch hat aviator power shot(I no you use a colored one)  for grey halo  and maybe the grey septum’s 
Absolutely possible! I'm a straight guy and women and men obviously have a varying range of attraction. Objectively I would say working out to have a good, fit beach body, that sort of thing. Getting to 175 and adding some muscle would be good for sure. You have good skin and your face and style makes me think of a Josh Groban of a different ethnicity. Oh, and the turtleneck pictures are the worst imo.
Yeeeep. All of my med school/nurse/doctor friends smoke or have had a smoking habit. 
Hey I have no issue getting to sit in my car in the winter snow and let someone else do that for me.
You must have a hard time against wardens then ;)
One exterior photo of the front of the house.  No mention of any interior features, and this house has some very distinct interior features.  Im just trying to figure out what I need to do to file a reconsideration of value with the VA. I can provide better comps, but I’m pissed that this guy never entered the house from the looks of it and if the va approves the ROV I have to pay another $500 for another appraisal. This guy doesn’t deserve to be paid.
Is it a good time to post still? :( Hope so!! I'm looking for something to wear on my work's holiday party, the dress code is fairly casual but still 'smart' -  _back_to_line_ I tried on [this dress](https://www.ae.com/es/women-ae-crushed-velvet-off-the-shoulder-flutter-dress-navy/web/s-prod/0395_2005_410?cm=sMX-cMXN&amp;catId=cat8350042&amp;cid=AE_CSE_140710) today and I really liked the way it looked on, but I suck at fashion :( - any thoughts on it?  I thought maybe wearing a blazer or cardigan over it? Is it appropriate?  I also thought about [this one](https://www.ae.com/es/women-ae-crushed-velvet-strappy-back-dress-lavender/web/s-prod/1399_1977_580?cm=sMX-cMXN&amp;catId=cat8350042&amp;recs=rv_pdp_women_1399_1977_580) but I'm not sure about it either. For some background: I'm a 23 year old girl, my height is 1.56m and my weight is 45k :)

Thats a good point... Why mention /u/stylemistake though... they wrote about this after (recently) I did. 
It's one of two parts of the argument.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Race realism is one part - what you just said - that there is a scientific correlation between races and IQ.  This is usually coupled with the correlation that IQ is directly related to tendency for violence.  The lower the IQ, the higher the propensity for violence. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The second part of it is taking this argument, then applying it for white supremacism or white nationalism.  Both of these *sub* movements are actually two different entities. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ White nationalism usually goes with the saying *Asia for the Asians, Africa for the Africans, and Europe for the Europeans.*  The argument these folks make is that people have a *tendency* (i.e. bell curve) to group up with people who look like them and act like them.  With most of us in this sub being center-left, we obviously think otherwise, but let's go with this argument.  Even when immigrants migrate to a country, instead of integrating with the population, a lot of them tend to self-segregate themselves into *communities* (i.e. Chinatowns and Koreantowns, for example).  For this reason, they argue that rather than forcing people to get along with each other who are of disparate cultures and races, that the races should fuck off back to their original countries of origin because we work better that way. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ They use the excuse of race realism to openly discriminate against lower IQ races because they point to crime statistics that back up their argument that these races are inherently *more presupposed* to violence and behavior that is incompatible with Western culture.  Counterarguments made by individualists who say *But I know (this black guy) and he's nothing like that at all!* are responded with by pointing out how the bell curve means there WILL be a small population that breaks this trend, but a MAJORITY of that population fall within that IQ range. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ How would we do this?  According to white ethno nationalists, they want the government to incentivize non-whites leaving the country.  Not by *negative* discrimination, but *positive* discrimination - offer them money to leave and relocate back to their country of origin. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Nevermind the fact this expands the power of government and what if people were to refuse?  Yep - you guessed it, they will be FORCED out... authoritarianism in another ideology. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Right-libertarians openly oppose white nationalists because to get the utopia these white nationalists want, they'd have to expand the power of government, which is against libertarian ideals. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ White supremacists on the other hand are the strawman that SJWs bitch and whine about.  The ones who think the HUWITE race is the superior race and is responsible for everything positive in today's society.  The ones who openly discriminate against ethnic minorities, and some of them even go to the next level to openly discriminate against Jewish people, arguing the Holocaust is a myth (you might see some of them use the meme of MUH 6 GORILLION) or whatnot and openly will accuse the rest of us of being brainwashed. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ They're pretty fucking loud on /pol/ but hey, /pol/ is /pol/

People will be so prideful that they will throw insults even if they're at a disadvantage, as a coping mechanism. Especially in online games.

I don't think you could pin attempted murder on him even if it was glass. Attempted murder requires intent and I don't think anyone could say he was intending to kill the person by throwing a glass at them.
No honestly the mods do a great job. I hope this sub isn't too hard to moderate. It is just a bunch of nuts talking to each other every day but I imagine I'd be surprised at how much crap they have to deal with.
Glad to hear hun 😘
&gt; your experience in reading this is not physical at all. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I would say the exact opposite, if you could record exactly what every fundamental particle in my body does, you could recreate the feeling and experience I have and duplicate it for everyone, regardless of if they can read or not. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;Science is useful, but cannot explain the full range of human experience. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If we can actually measure everything that happens in the bodyand how everything in out body interacts, even hypothetically, which is a natural conclusion of any determinism, there should be no doubt that we *can* explain the full range or experiences.

&gt;Guys generally have far lower standards than we should, because we've been told for years that if we don't like a women or can't handle her flaws, we're bad people. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Be honest - is it really the above reason OR a lack of options + the appeal of frequent (or at least available) sex?
I did turn in an appeal earlier today. It was my first time going to the health center so I didn't know I had to get a guardians permission. And I didn't want my parents to know I went. Do you know if they would forgive a situation like that? 
Mind sharing the trade package you speak of? 
Agreed. I definitely don’t want to come off as defending the use of the n-word, for sure, but they literally have two completely different standards for what an “acceptable” apology is. 
hmmm, yes good thought. I'll add pasta to the list! As long as there's no cheese haha
At half the speed!
I thought it looked familiar. I was there during a layover about two years ago. https://imgur.com/a/DDXK0
I don't think requires is the right word. I can't think of time I've ever invested in endurance, much less its perks, in survival mode. Then again I play a stealthy sniper/pistols build most of the time, so if the enemy attacks me one already messed up anyway. :p
Yup Boise turned down the the AAC offer to get a preferential revenue split from the MWC instead.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Which is also why it's unlikely Boise leaves until the new TV contacts are worked out in the 2020's. 
Yeah I have the same hope, problem is that would make the Diversionist Class overpowered.  Meanwhile the SR635 is a wicked little SMG.
Nope, 35psi. Rode it home as is after work.
Renounce your US citizenship and move to pretty much any other developed nation. 
Yeah I've actually started focusing on doing some life drawings lately. Downloaded proko's free figure drawing pack, drew some of those, and have been drawing whatever happens to be on my desk at the time I'm drawing. I have 5 or 6pages of life drawings from today it's just still a big weak point so I didn't post them.

Last week I started to send naughty text messages to my wife.  I started with some very soft inuendos and she responded in kind!  We took it a few steps futher yesterday.  It is a new thing for both of us and I am so glad she finds it exciting.  She gave me permission to sext our FWB too, so I should do that soon.
Congratulations! You have the job!
This kind of thing is why football is so dangerous. Wins matter so much that guys are expected to put their health on the line to perform. Hopefully he doesn’t experience any further damage. 
Thanks for proving my point!  LOL. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The fact that they didn't even need to score 20 points in either victory just goes to show who the real SB MVP was - that defense.
Its time to ditch that boosted supp role and start maining ADC, huh Michael ?
Omg I love that movie! 😂

So they're a certain section of the Scottish then.
I really hope Noctis plays more like a Tekken character. I just cannot get into the SF/KoF move commands despite playing SF for years.

oh, it definitely applies to constructs, too. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ [*The DC to craft a construct is 5 + the default caster level of the construct, just like for a magic item. Like when crafting magic items, a creator with a sufficiently high skill bonus may ignore these requirements. *](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/building-and-modifying-constructs/) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ You are 100% correct that if it didn't work like that, it would be B.S. though. Rules that work one way for one thing, then stop working that way when they *feel* like it are absurd.
