According to Patreon's terms of use I actually have to keep everything that contains nudity restricted as patron view only.

What you're talking about are incredibly fringe and (at least personally for me) unconvincing examples that miss my point. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ People chanting *blood and soil* is what I'm talking about.

People saying transgender people *don't have rights* is what I'm talking about. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ To your last point: like so many scourges, it may have begun ironically, but now there are actually a frightening amount of people (including several celebrities) who literally believe that.

Forgive me, I was speaking more to my past although I am still a student.

Thanks for the reply. I think one can definitely whatabout a whatabout, especially when a line has been drawn between the first and second (as I tend to think when a new post has been made). I do admit this might be a grey area, but I was curious what your thought process was. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Here is what I was thinking. Even though this is definitely a reaction to the other posts, it is its own post. What do you think about treating this like a new post, and arguing the merits (or lack thereof) of the post content itself? That seems to me like it could be a good illustration of what might be a better way to handle these types of things instead of whatabouting almost immediately back to the other topic in a different post. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ But I do admit my emotions were high when I wrote that previous comment, and it might have been overly critical, so I am sorry for that.
I meant the other guys. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I think time has eased the pain of that decision.

If it gives any sort of perspective or confidence in applying for a visa: I'm from the UK and applied for a travel visa to hike this year and I got accepted - I don't have property of my own, I had no previous backpacking or real hiking experience, I have savings but I was just coming out of employment to hike and my application was successful. That said, I read replies from others who had theirs declined and, to me, they sounded *safer* as candidates than myself.. so, anything's possible as long as it sounds like you're coming home after your hike. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ As for the rest of your questions: I think most people start in April going Northbound, which I did and I'd recommend that or even a *little* later if you wanted to do 3 months or less of hiking - it was still cold enough to snow in Georgia and Tennessee during April/early May. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ You're also not crazy for wanting to give it a try with little hiking experience. I think a lot of people see it as a way to try something new - I used it as a way to get completely out of my comfort zones since I'm not really much of an outdoor person.. well, I didn't used to be anyway. 
Either one works, as long as it's permanent. The world has enough stupid, gullible people in it already.

&gt;How do you keep your feudal vassals from destroying your titular republics? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Disallowing internal wars and/or not granting out the duchy that the republic is in, instead transferring the vassals to a number of different duchies, eg: if you give a republic a titular title of gotland in the duchy of gotland, vassal transfer the other two counties that are in that duchy to different dukes (or grant them the counties directly).  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It's important to make sure you transfer *as few counties as possible* to each duke, that way you minimize the risk of them being able to create the ducal title &amp; claim the county your republic is in. _back_to_line_

Yup, hard to time the market, just need to take it slow, make a few logical moves to lock in gains. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Acb buy acb@ 3.5 - sell all at 6.9, buy back more at 5.75 - sell 50% at 7.5 today. Didn't expect it to hit 8 but that's why I still have 50% in. Going to try to buy back in @ 6.5
I mean, idk if financial reasons are a valid reason. It just gives the cards value. In fact if this is true, then it may balance out the set a bit. People looking for the full art lands can rejoice since they would no longer be the primary financial driver of the set and will be cheaper as a result. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I think it may not happen because of reasons related to how silver cards interact with the game. Such as the boring gotcha cards, subgame cards, deterity cards, vintage powered cards, etc. Granted the new set is pretty balanced with a few exceptions. They would need a relatively large banlist for the previous sets. Maybe they were moving towards this all along.

And in any other color he would be OP. Same with Gortwog in Scout or Mage. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ However, Warrior as a class just doesn't cut it. Tempo swings are not as good, prophecies are not as strong and there's hardly anything that helps you gain card advantage. Wind Keep Spellsword  and Aela's Huntmate are not enough. More than that, because you include the latter your options are limited at 4. I'd love to include Earthbone Spinner, Dushnikh, Garnag, Reive and Fell the Mighty on the same list, but that means giving up on draw. Even Sower's slot is problematic. Blood Dragon, Vigilante and Sower make for a tough call which 2 of the 3 should I include.
Sure, one tricks can be reported because they play one hero to the exclusion of all others, even when switching heroes sometimes is a necessary part of the game. When they are reported it must be for bad team work, if enough people (as determined by blizzard) within a certain span of games report them for bad team work, we should pay attention and take action. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It isn't my favorite solution, my favorite solution is diminishing returns on SR for playing the same hero over and over, stacking until they eventually lose SR even for wins on that one hero or determining ban status by percentages of games played as that hero vs. others, and using that in tandem with reports. The fact of the matter is that if you have to play one hero for a chance at winning at a certain level of play then you shouldn't be at that level of play, you can only get that high by exploiting the system.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I have no issues with maining, but one hero is too constrained in this game, you need to have a small pool. Playing one hero in the current system is effectively an exploit tricking the system into thinking you're better at the game than you are, as evidenced by your inability to play anything more than a tiny fraction of the heroes. If you really want to one-trick, get the hell out of comp and play quick play and the like, because that is by definition noncompetitive.  
Perfect!

I don't have GMS2 so I can't tell you about whether it stores view and camera positions seperately.  My observation would be that the view position wouldn't make much sense if the camera is not looking directly down the z axis.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Anyway, the way I worked out those formulas was like this: _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ https://imgur.com/Q2K2Kpv _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ the up vector points toward the top of the *view*.  The left vector is perpendicular to the up vector.  If you have a vector (x,y), then a vector that is 90 degrees counter-clockwise of that vector is (y,-x).  This is only true if +x goes right, and +y goes down).  Anyway, just take the left vector and scale it according to half the view width, and then take the up vector and scale it according to half the view height, add the results together, and that is that is the position (in the xy plane) of the upper-left corner of the view relative to the camera position.  Add the camera position to that, and you get the absolute position of the upper-left corner of the view in the xy plane.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ By the way, my original suggestion is to use the gui draw event to draw gui elements.  However, there could be situations where it could be useful to be able to compute the location of the corner of the view.

:-) Weinstein and guys like him aren‚Äôt interested in just getting a blow job from a pretty young thing, they can get that from a prostitute or someone they persuade at a bar.

That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs wrong, and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs assault, and that‚Äôs why someone like Uma is a victim despite being loaded rich.

For example, right now, in America, I would not feel comfortable saying the word *nigger* in public even if it were to *quote* someone else saying it, or to discuss the effects of the word itself.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Isn't that ridiculous?   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ That it's frowned upon to say it even when actively *in a discussion about the word itself?* You see this any time it's brought up. People have to tiptoe around it. The most ridiculous part is saying *the N word.* [(Relevant)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dF1NUposXVQ) In short, it doesn't matter how much you tiptoe around it or replace it with other things. Everyone already knows what word you're talking about, so there is literally nothing worse about just saying *nigger.* 
Verse 9:111 ‚Äì Muslim's passport to paradise _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *Lo! Allah hath bought from the believers their lives and their wealth because the Garden will be theirs: they shall fight in the way of Allah and shall slay and be slain. It is a promise which is binding on Him in the Torah and the Gospel and the Qur'an. Who fulfilleth His covenant better than Allah? Rejoice then in your bargain that ye have made, for that is the supreme triumph.* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Islam teaches that if Muslims slay or are slain (kill or are killed) in the service of God, i.e. Jihad, they are guaranteed accession to Allah's paradise of depraved sexual perversity. Islam's Paradise is filled with whorish virgins possessing voluptuous breasts and lustrous eyes. Muslims, blessed with an access to Paradise, will have 72 such virgins to engage in incessant copulation. Furthermore, a Muslim's surest way of getting a passport to Paradise, says Allah, is to get slain while trying to kill the kafirs. The Quran is no more a holy book than Playboy, Penthouse, and Hustler are holy books. Indeed, the Quran is worse in that it incites unrestrained murder of infidels. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Most evil teaching # 2: Kill the infidels wherever you find them _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Quran 9:5 (the infamous verse of the sword inciting mass murder): _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *Then, when the sacred months have passed, slay the idolaters wherever ye find them, and take them (captive), and besiege them, and prepare for them each ambush. But if they repent and establish worship and pay the poor-due, then leave their way free. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Verse 9:5 teaches Muslims to commit mass-murder. The kafirs must either convert to Islam, who would keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate (zakat), or be murdered. Command for unconditional slaying of humans, God's own creations, by other humans ‚Äì when presented as a sacred teaching of the almighty Creator ‚Äì becomes a most evil teaching. Needless to say, such teachings never came from God. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 
&gt;What the hell? The Syrian government and its allies are *opportunist* for defending Syria against imperialist invasion, but this little circle that implicitly supports U.S. imperialism and ridiculously enough blames the Syrian government for all of the war deaths (because it's not like al-Qaeda, HTS and Daesh execute civilians...) is *consistently anti-imperialist*?  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Who said that the Syrian government and its allies were trying to defend Syria against anyone let alone imperialism? Bashar Assad is just the typical comprador bureaucrat capitalist who defends their own class and the interests of this class against the masses. He's always been and opportunist and kowtows to any imperialist offering him a better deal(guess we all forgot how he was the good client state for the CIA when it came to extraordinary rendition, right?). Also allying oneself with one sphere of imperialism(Russian) against another(U.S) doesn't make you an anti-imperialist it puts you on the side of world imperialism. Why do tankies like you persist in your garbage, outdated Kautskyite understanding of imperialism? But judging by your greenflag name you probably got your politics from that trash green book.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;Also, China under Mao before the TWT supported independent Syria and all other independent states of the Third World against imperialism, so how come you aren't? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Oh wow so I guess I should smoke cigarettes like Mao did too right? Hopefully, having a bald head will make me a better Maoist? You know I can actually criticize Mao the person and be a Maoist and have a Maoist criticism, right? It's not that hard actually especially since Mao wasn't infallible. The right of self-determination is always in relation to the interests of the proletariat class and it is a right which doesn't include violating the interest of the proletariat or the right to oppress other nations. So when Daddy Assad does both just like Little Assad does now, Communists don't support that.

I'm just saying there's a reason Huma didn't take his last name.  If I married him I wouldn't take his last name either.
Also if they did, i'm fairly certain the relativistic orbital velocities of the electrons would create a charge imbalance in non-ionic matter, perhaps all matter. I'm not a great physicist by any stretch, but the effects of that would be interesting to speculate about. 
I can agree to that, I just don't feel the lonely part. I  prefer doing my own thing than with others. I found that out by moving here.    _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Maybe I have already embraced the characteristic to far?  But I like not having to say hi to people.  My resting bitch face is down pat.  I go entire weekends sometimes without saying word to anyone.  Its fan-fucking tastic!   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ And I already got the girl scout badge for the Vancouver party, club, health-nut, meetup, and social butterfly and dating scenes. Those just showed me time and again I prefer my solitude in Vancouver. I have a life plan (built 100% on my own - I'm no trust fund chick) that has my future looking very stable and rewarding. It makes me happy watching it all happen as I work towards those goals. So, Sorry Vancouver, you're just not worth risking that for.

Thank you 
So there are some things you can do.  Ironically 15 days ago on reddit, some pushed a link for http://hexabot.us on a reddit on the bitcoin forum.  I've been missing out on bitcoin since 2013 (I was telling my buddy how they were $10, but didn't know crap).  Seeing the spike in the news, I bought some litecoin.  Easier with the physiological barrier.  I bought from Coinbase, before GDAX (because I didn't know better).  The site promised compounding a 20 percent.  I heard of a few others and some site that went under (I really started just 15 days ago).  So anyways, after 1 week in having 13 litecoins, I jumped to 16.  Been buying more light coins, sitting at 25, so hope to hit 30 by monday.  I hate these bank transfers with GDAX and really pushed $5000 and hope it comes in soon (took 3 days to hit the bank).  I'm really obsessed with getting the litecoin (and now get this to the moon phrase).  Anyways, best of luck to you and check out as much as you can.  I think there is bitconnect and some other things people are doing also.  How do you project yourself in the next few months?  I'm trying to learn about hardware wallets to store some of them incase I lose some from the site.  Not wise to have them all sit in one place.

I watched a live stream once, and this girl came back as Tommy.  She swam to the edge of the water and sat there until the timer ran out.  The entire chat was trying to find Jason's Steam ID so they could tell him she was in the water.  Normally, I don't condone giving away that information, but she deserved it because she didn't even try to help anyone.   _back_to_line_ But, he never found her and she survived the match.  The guy playing Jason was frustrated as all get out after he found out in the lobby
Tomorrow *is* Saturday here in NZ. :) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I like the idea of RWD conceptually - but that RS265 really was incredible around corners. Our little Suzuki Swift Sport we haul the dogs around in is also pretty excellent to throw around.
That's not really quite the same thing as being third world, even though there is a lot of overlap. And none the less, it doesn't change the fact they *were* a second world country when the phrase still had meaning. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-world_model#/media/File:Cold_War_alliances_mid-1975.svg _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ As you can see compared to the NAM map, both countries that were first and second are also in NAM. It doesn't really translate to the three world model exactly.
Cook basically goosed last week too so if that's your concern I don't think you're in that much of a better position

Socialism and capitalism are about **who owns the means of production.** You can tax corporations and individuals at 99% but, for example, as long as the means of production at Wal-Mart is owned by the Walton family then socialism is not taking place. In socialism, the ownership of Wal-mart would be transferred to the government and the profits would be redistributed or the ownership would be transferred collectively to the workers who do the actual labor. Socialism removes the passive income owner of the business under the belief that they are hoarding the profits for themselves while the workers are exploited for low wages.

&gt;Religion is quickly dying in the UK so any religious aspect of the whole thing from the US certainly won't apply here.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It's like that on the coasts here.

Yeah, I am definitely a BFG fan.
No honestly the mods do a great job. I hope this sub isn't too hard to moderate. It is just a bunch of nuts talking to each other every day but I imagine I'd be surprised at how much crap they have to deal with.

It objectively is. Average fees are currently slightly cheaper with ltc than Bch and transaction times are way faster on ltc, by a factor of nearly 5x.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Are we not talking about the same thing or something? This is all publicly available and easily-verifiable info. 
Not saying anything about his personality, more about the idea of getting rid of a homegrown gold glover that helped us win a ring to get a high paid slugger. I still think trading Duffy, while smart in hindsight, at the time set a bad precedent.

Just about everyday you will see a post here or on r/investing about a recession coming and holding cash. The answer is always *Time in the market beats timing the market*.  People that sold a year ago thinking a recession is coming have missed out on +/-20% gains over the last 12 months, and you never know if the market will gain another 20% before a correction brings prices to where they are now.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Also, you are not investing for where the market will be in a year or 2, you are investing for where it will be in 20-40 years which will be higher than it is now

I've seen all of that, but you also ignore all context of everything you paste.  You obviously care a lot about this and feel very strongly about it.  No doubt when you train in a gym, you have to instill an intensity in yourself to push yourself harder and you bring that into online discussion.  Don't mistake that intensity and confidence for absolute truth. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I can understand how spending a lot of time in a gym, training and fighting people can grow a feeling of relative invincibility, but humans are fragile.  Strong people die helplessly all the time in ways they don't deserve.
It's like professional sports. Is it hard work or natural talent? At that level it's both. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Luck is essentially just opportunity + preparation (unless a bag of many fell out of an airplane into your back yard or you won the powerball). 
The question is flawed to begin with and based on someone doesn't understand why Trump does something so simple.

We are definitely getting more microtransactions. I think Rockstar has enough respect from me that I personally believe they will find a way to implement it and make it so that it doesn't suck for newer players who jump in and make it so that the grind is less monotonous and more seamless. Another reason I have faith is the fact that this game will be purely next gen. I like to think a lot of GTA V was limited by the last gen. With the new generation, I hope they include lots of in world activities that make money but don't require long load times between lobbies. I fucking hated staring at that dumb birds eye view blurry mess everytime I left and joined a race lobby or something.
There should be instructions in/on the box, or on the Gate website. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If you go the Titan route, it's drop-in; no soldering required.

It's a 9 Mana sorcery.
I've been listening to you, but I don't think you're making much sense, which is why I'm debating your points. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The Pixel 2 is struggling for light in darker scenes, with loss of detail as a result. It attempts to compensate this by maxing out ISO, which introduces a ton of noise instead. This is something the iPhone X manages to avoid. The iPhone X also captured the scene closer to how the lighting situation *actually* was, according to the photographer. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Just for you, I attempted to match exposures though: _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Trainstation: https://i.imgur.com/wJrgA5W.png (+1 EV) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Building: https://i.imgur.com/nn4Drp3.png (+0.5 EV) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I hope you'll agree that not only is the iPhone X more detailed, it has significantly less noise at the same exposure. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If you prefer brighter rather than more light-accurate low-light photos, you can always dial up exposure on the iPhone before capturing the photo. The resulting image will still be better than the Pixel 2, as shown here.

&gt;Is this not what you would consider us? If not, why? You're absolutely engaging in antagonistic activities against me and you're absolutely a political opponent at minimum. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I don't consider you my enemy.  I especially don't consider yall enemies of the US.  I consider yall my cousins, separated by our ancestral migratory paths. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I look at the political climate today and I see three sides: one who seeks short-term individual benefit at the cost of long-term societal sustainability, one who seeks long-term societal societal sustainability at short-term individual cost, and the silent ones who really only care about living their lives unhindered by the other two. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Rising above politics, we're all the same.  We want a stable source of food, and we want our progeny to have a stable source of food.  Everything else is window dressing.  Calling one group of humans 'enemy' only dehumanizes them, bringing us further from working in concert to utilize our resources to guarantee good living for those in the present and future. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It's like the myth of the tower of Babel.  We can achieve something godly, but only when we're speaking the same language.  When we stop communicating by other-ing those with whom we disagree, we only hurt ourselves.
I guess all extra money goes into pockets of the oligarchs and then into their luxurious London apartments and offshore bank accounts. The sorry state of the *patriotism* of the the Russian ruling class. If they cared even a bit they would invest the stolen money in their own home country. But no.
Ah well see, there's a reason Howard and Lovecraft were only friends through correspondence.  Their world views were quite opposed, namely Lovecraft's obsession with Anglo-Teutonic purity, and Howard's Celtophilia and love of anything barbaric, that's discussed in the thread as well I think.  Howard's probably going to be an AUS fan to be honest.

When he was on alphabay he was reselling gemini6969 which was probably worth that much. Since he is only on dream gemini6969 stopped selling. Which is why dank went dry. He tried to resell lord Hermes but the quality wasn‚Äôt there to charge that. Topshelfcanna is the vendor he uses now I know dank very well he is a weak vendor not to be trusted with a cent let alone 5zips. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Dank was good at one point I‚Äôm sure a lot of people used him. But his quality dramatically slipped. He claims he has superman og still it‚Äôs bullshit. _back_to_line_ He can‚Äôt get thin mint cookies or any cookiefam.  _back_to_line_ I even pointed out r/mr_taffy to him but he said it‚Äôs to expensive and people wouldn‚Äôt know the quality difference. It‚Äôs actually really stupid of him what he‚Äôs done to his name. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ P.S no one has ever had anything good to say about him on reddit lol and his feedback is only good because he will threaten to DOX u if u don‚Äôt

Basically, 99% of fights are when somebody takes a cheap shot or pulls a bitch move.  See: Ramsey, Jalen vs Green, AJ. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ And it's because the NFL has a culture where fighting isn't effectively incentivized like it is in hockey.  And it's a good thing.

There's no excuse, nor any reason, for these guys to attack other players. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Honestly, I think fighting should be a cascading punishment.

&gt;However, if a Hung Gar practitioner were to use low stances in a Muay Thai match _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If it's in the context of Muay Thai fine. If it's in a street fight, it coul be different. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;there are still aspects of those arts that are usually ineffective _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Newsflash: EVERY style has it's strength and weaknesses. Take boxing for example. In a street fight you could very well break your hand punching someone, does that mean you shouldn't box. Or if you do Judo, BJJ, Wrestling or Sambo. Should you not train those arts just because grappling may not be deisrable if you have multiple or armed attackers? No.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Hell, even Krav Maga has a bit of a problem regarding fradulent instructors who teach bullshit concepts, yet that doesn't discredit Krav Maga as a whole. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;Either way, traditional arts aren't always useless, although some pretty much are, like Tai Chi. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I agree with this point. Take Aikido. With Karate, Taekwondo, and most other TMA's you can at least spar with the punches and kicks and strikes. With Aikido, the moves aren't even able to be sparred with. There's a great vid on the subject I will link. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ In the end man(I'm a former Taekwondo practicioner too that still uses the kicks and footwork), my point is while it's fair to say TMA suffer a bit more from bad instructors and bs training you shouldn't tell people the art itself isn't effectve, it would be better to say ''certain schools of arts X, Y, and Z tend to not do so well but not all are like this.'' _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ This site puts it best: _back_to_line_ http://mcdojo-faq.tripod.com/ _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;Most people have this notion that style is the most important aspect in choosing a martial art, as well as some people automatically brand traditional schools or all Karate and Taekwondo schools as McDojos or useless.  This isn't true.  Not all Taekwondo or Karate schools are McDojos, although they do seem to hold a higher percentage in McDojos.  However good schools exist and so you should never simple dismiss a style (unless it's a made up or bullshido style such as Dim Mak).  The quality of the instructor is far more important that what style they happen to teach. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Also if by other problems you mean kata and such, how much that is emphasized and whether a school teaches application of kata(bunkai) is dependent on the school and not style. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_

Feelz?
The point I am making is that most would pick the other class over the TR in these situations.  That is the issue at the heart of this debate.  The TR does have a skill that debuffs enemies.  It just isn't that great.  There are 3 types of utility abilities that are used by support chars to help the party.  Healing of the members, buffing the members, debuffing the enemies.  The TR needs to be best at one of those three or just as good at one of those three to get into the support role for the group.  FYI, there are some places that healing is better than reducing the damage taken before I get more feedback.    _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Example of what I see as equality would be in the game:  _back_to_line_ Say one class buffs the party by 20% and can debuff the enemies 20%.  To have the same want to have another class that does this in the party with this role the other support class needs to add up to 40% buffs/debuffs to equal out want to have that class in the party.  If I have a class that can only buff the party members 25% with 5% debuffs you won't see them as wanted in the party.  They only are adding to the party 30% buffs/debuffs to the party which is 10% less brought by the class to help the party.  While you could still work with a character that gives the lower amount of value added to the party you will see a trend of people asking to not have the lower quality character in their content if they want to do better.  If you can barely do the content to begin with then those extra buffs/debuffs it may mean the difference between completing the dungeon and not completing the dungeon.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ This is the TR right now cause it is capable of doing content but it doesn't bring the same capabilities to the table as the other classes.  This is why they are being in a way shunned.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I tabled working on my 15K+ TR to build up other classes because of this issue.  Who wants to play a class that is shunned in parties since it is the lesser option to bring along.  I now have a 14K DC that is asked to be in parties all the time...  I want the TR to be wanted but I also know that other people in other classes prefer to have them crappy cause they dislike the class or someone that plays the class.

Thank you Anthony_Vapes, That is very clear and concise information into the review world. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Ive always stood behind the Idea that the best reviewers point out the problems in a product big and small. Anyone can post videos raving about how great something is and glossing over negatives. But the Negatives are truly the most important part of a review, as that constitutes the bulk of whether a product is worth buying, watching, playing, or reading.

I've answered this before, though honestly it's not asked very often. It's horribly long, because I literally walk them through our entire process. If you really want the answer I can dig it out from an email- just have to find one it's in. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The answer to the second part is yes. I can think of one puppy in particular who was showing a lot of shy, backwards tendencies early on and we could tell that she was going to need a LOT of socialization and confidence building. The one good fit for a home we did offer her to wound up getting another puppy elsewhere, and none of the remaining prospective homes, through any fault of their own, were going to be able to offer her what she needed. So we kept her to ensure she got what she needed. She wound up being the most outgoing and silly dog ever that we later placed as an adult and has a wonderful perfect home now. As for the other homes, we told them what was going on with that puppy and referred them to other breeders who either had available puppies or puppies on the way.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-72#Interior _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; Like all Soviet-legacy tanks, the T-72's design has traded off interior space in return for a very small silhouette and efficient use of armour, to the point of replacing the fourth crewman with a mechanical loader. The basic T-72 design has extremely small periscope viewports, even by the constrained standards of battle tanks and the driver's field of vision is significantly reduced when his hatch is closed. The steering system is a traditional dual-tiller layout instead of the easier-to-use steering wheel or steering yoke common in modern Western tanks. This set-up requires the near-constant use of both hands, which complicates employment of the seven speed manual transmission. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; There is a widespread Cold War-era myth that T-72 and other Soviet tanks are so cramped that the small interior demands the use of shorter crewmen, with the maximum height set at 1.6 m (5 ft 3 in) in the Soviet Army.[35] According to official regulations, however, the actual figure is 1.75 m (5 ft 9 in)[36] _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ EDIT: [Cross section](https://78.media.tumblr.com/7b7807a78ec364a4880fb1c0d684ff6b/tumblr_o6mr57rCjE1r94kvzo2_1280.jpg) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ As you can see comparing the top-down view with the side-view, the driver really has no way to interact with the commander other than yelling.  He slides in through a hatch on the hull just under the main gun (which would be moved to the side) and sits in his small chair.  To be fair, he probably has more room than the gunner, which would be the bottom chair in the top-down view. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ EDIT 2: Further review of the video this is likely a T-90, not a T-72.  Though the comparison can be made. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-90 _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; The tank is a modern variation of the T-72B and incorporates many features found on the T-80U. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Speaking of the T-80...   _back_to_line_ [Gunner position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:T-80U_tank_interior_-01.jpg)   _back_to_line_ [Commander position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:T-80U_tank_interior_-04.jpg)

If you look at publications covering MMA from this period, none of them counted Pancrase fights, or Pancrase style fights, in a fighter's NHB record. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Think of it as Pancrase being treated as a cousin of MMA/NHB, but not quite the same because the differences in the rules made the fights significantly different. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It didn't become common for Pancrase records to be combined with NHB/MMA records until later on. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ That is why those fights are missing from the records of Frank Shamrock, Maurice Smith, Guy Mezger, and others listed. There were definitely people that thought Pancrase was a total work (Joe Silva wrote a letter to the Wrestling Observer Newsletter in 1996ish incensed that people believed Pancrase fights were real), but that's not the reason why those fights weren't included in NHB records at the time. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Having said that, Frank's Pancrase fights in particular had to have been weighed for him to get the #2 spot here.

Yes, I'm pro-homesteading, when the property in question was not attained through any violent means. But once the property is homesteaded, and it is made clear where it begins and ends by a fence, so that *intrusion* would have to be deliberate, I believe the homesteader has the right to protect this land from intruders, even if that means using (nonlethal) force.

This is literally the entire premise of getting your internet through an ISP instead of having a dedicated line. The argument however is to what degree ISP's are allowed to push their margins and advertise speeds that the user will usually not be able to get.
&gt; this article provides a pretty good explanation for why you are wrong. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I somewhat agree with the general premise, but the arguments used in that article are crap. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; *Moreover, women who send the first message wind up meeting more attractive men than women who wait for a man to ping them, the report finds. That's because women generally message men who are five points more attractive (as rated by OKCupid users) than they are, while they typically receive messages from men who are seven points less attractive than they are.* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ What the averages are *doesn't matter* because women aren't saying *yes* to every guy who asks her out. She rejects most of them. Theoretically, if three guys ask her out, and they are rated as 0 points, 7 points, and 14 points lower than her (i.e. the three guys are an average of 7 points lower than her), she'll say yes to the first guy and no to the next two. This means she's going on a date with a guy exactly at her level. The same might be true of the guys she asks out. Say she asks out three guys who are 0 points, 5 points, and 10 points better than her (i.e. the three guys are an average of 5 points higher than her), but only the guy who's at her level (0 points above her) says yes, then she ends up with a guy who's also at her level. It doesn't matter what the average point difference is between guys who message her and guys she messages. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; If this was a 1950s-style dating scenario in which the boys approached the girls, each boy would hit on his top-choice girl, Fry says. If a girl has multiple offers, she would choose the boy she preferred most, and if a boy were rejected, he would approach his second-choice girl. The result is pretty great for the boys. Each gets his first- or second-choice partner, and there is no way the boys could improve, because their top choices have said yes or already rejected them. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ This is nonsense because a guy might approach his top-choice, get rejected because she's waiting for another guy to ask her out, then that second guy never asks her out, so she'd be willing to date the first guy who asked her, but he he moved on to another girl. In that case, he doesn't end up with his top choice. If the *asking* roles were reversed, she would ask guy #2 (who would reject her), then ask guy #1 (who would say yes) - and guy#1 would end up with his first choice. Whoever did the game-theory on this is wrong. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Still, I agree with the general argument that *if you don't ask women out, you're probably going to die alone* because most women are shitty at asking guys out.

I had  little religious understanding until I took the discussions. My parents taught us nothing. I barely knew who Jesus Christ was when the Elders started teaching me. Both of my parents were raised in Godless homes. As was I. I felt totally unprepared as an 18 year old to start just then learning about religion. When I started meeting with the Elders I scoured every religion. I compared them all. I went to mass, synagogue, non-denominational, Lutheran churches. You name it.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I grew up in a heavy Jewish and Catholic area of Chicago. My friends had so many religious traditions that we never had. We did Christmas and Easter in the very worldly sense but that was all. As a child I had questions about religion but not really any one to ask because it was such a non-topic. I would attend youth groups and Christian camps and I felt like an outsider but was drawn to it. Honestly if I could go back I'd probably be Jewish. I love the culture so much.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I'm rambling. I did resent my parents for teaching me nothing when I finally found a path I liked. I embraced Mormonism more fully than anything. It became my family, my life. Until it wasn't. It's all lies and that broke my heart so much. I gave it all.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ We are raising our kids as atheists. BUT, and here's the difference, we have excellent communication with our kids. We talk and talk and talk and they talk and talk and talk. It's an open door both ways. In my household growing up, there were no feelings, thoughts or sensitivities. I'm sure you're doing a great job. The comment I made here has been in my head all day actually. They were right after all. The execution sucked, but they were right and I need to apologize for cutting them out of my life when I joined the church.

Here is every comment you have made in this thread: _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 1- *Feel free to read the comments I already posted in this very thread.* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 2- *Are you here to make a point that hasn't already been made?* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 3- *What an original comment, haven't read that before.* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 4- *I'm not always using my knives. _back_to_line_ Is it that hard to recognize that everything about a dull knife might not be completely bad? Sometimes things are not entirely black and white.* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 5- *Or a clean cut versus not a cut. _back_to_line_ Source: have bounced dull knives off my finger in my lifetime.* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 6- *That being said, if you fuck up with a sharp knife, you are still more likely to cut yourself than if you fuck up with a dull knife.* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 7- *Oh noes! Wherever are the pitchforks!?!* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ ---------------------------- _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Comments 1,2,3, and 7 have no relevance whatsoever. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Comment 4 is the comment I have already previously mentioned, where you still have yet to tell me a good reason to have a dull knife. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Comment 5 - you make the claim that a dull knife is *better* because it won't cut you at all.  At this point your knife is garbage and should be thrown out, or sharpened so that it is actually useful, like I had previously suggested.  The only reason a knife that won't even cut skin is useful is if you are literally using it as a tool that won't cut things.  Since this is the complete opposite of what a knife is supposed to do, this comment is also irrelevant. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Comment 6- Yes a sharp knife can cut through something better than a dull knife.  However, with a sharper knife, you have to use less force to cut.  With less force you are allowed more control, and if you do manage to cut yourself, you can stop much easier.  A sharp knife will also leave a much cleaner cut that will heal a lot better, than a cut from a dull knife. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ -------------------------- _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ So now that I have gone through all of your other comments, like you suggested I do, I would like to once again ask *What isn't bad about a dull knife?*  It seems to me, the dull knife is worse in objectively every way compared to a sharp knife. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ A dull knife needs more force, and therefore less control will be allowed. This leads to easier cuts _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ A dull knife will leave a more damaging wound and will not heal as well. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ A sharp knife performs its job to a much higher degree.

Ahhh, gotcha. Though again, organic doesn't mean no pesticides; it generally means no synthetic pesticides however.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Taken from Wikipedia: *Pesticides are allowed as long as they are not synthetic.[25] However, under US federal organic standards, if pests and weeds are not controllable through management practices, nor via organic pesticides and herbicides, *a substance included on the National List of synthetic substances allowed for use in organic crop production may be applied to prevent, suppress, or control pests, weeds, or diseases.*[26] * _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ But yeah, root vegetables are definitely more susceptible to absorbing pesticides. All the more reason to promote gmo's, in my opinion. It may be possible to create a plant that is resistant enough to bugs and blights to not warrant the use of any outside chemicals.

I have gradually been fixing this in my environment by deleting users roaming profiles and assisting them with rebuilding, but it is a pain. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The rest of the drama you experienced I have no idea what you did to reach such a broken state lol, but I've not tried to uninstall any modern apps since that's where they're moving things to.
*hugs back* Thanks so much. I may do that some time. This weekend is going to be really busy for me though, as I am moving all my stuff across a couple of states and it'll be a few trips. (that's why it took me so long to respond, was in the car for the long haul) I do appreciate th support. Sometimes I just need some encouragement.

Right... but some people have very lucrative FAN discounts, and more than a couple people have forgotten or been misinformed that it will work on Unlimited. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Only a few select corporate discounts qualify for Unlimited plans. So each person has to do their own math on if it makes sense. In some cases, with the right corporate discount, I would advise keeping the old plan - or setting up a second plan if it's a family situation.
I knew what you meant. Tbh you probably saved a lot of casuals from having to google it anyways.
Jokes aside, I totally forgot she was fighting this weekend and now I'm happy 
Some people have a really healthy brain so it takes a lot of abuse before their brain health deteriorates. Some people have a stress riddled brain and bad social support networks so it takes far less before they begin to feel the brain aches.

This is adorable and I love it.

Damn, your stuff is really great.

Zoe is the only Targon champ I really read up on and she was deffo just a normal girl.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/champion/zoe _back_to_line_ &gt; As befits her Targonian aspect‚Äôs nature, Zoe did not ascend to power in one of the traditional ways. She didn‚Äôt win a great victory against overwhelming odds, or sacrifice herself for a noble ideal, or overcome the existential trial of climbing Mount Targon. Instead, Zoe was a normal girl, seemingly chosen at random. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ From her lore I just guessed the Tarics and shit are hosts to the Aspects. I figured Bard is the only *born* powerful magic Targonian related thing we have in game right now besides Sol.

EVSE assumes that the car is a floating device, with insulated wheels, and a low voltage body ground. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ NEC assumes everything is a grounded device with uninsulated chasis. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Now NEC allows double insulated ungrounded devices, but it still wants a body ground.  More importantly, NEC wants to have ground  and a grounded conductor (Neutral), while J1772 sends 2 Phases and ground.  That's a deprecated approach under NEC.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 
Most republican voters, and democrats, would disagree. Of course you have outliers, but that's not the general consensus.

Most so-called NoSQL databases are just a variation of this: _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_     CREATE Table Everything ( Key guid PRIMARY KEY, Value [nVarChar | json| xml ] NOT NULL); _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Not exactly rocket science and really easy for a relational database to handle. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Sure they bolt on some sort of (usually half-assed) replication, but most relational databases have that as well. And really, that doesn't change your design patterns aside from being cognizant of the possibility for stale data.

That‚Äôs not a bad thing, it‚Äôs just something about him that‚Äôs probably different. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ **I am not completely incompetent in social situations just because I‚Äôm an autistic, I am just a bit awkward and I miss some social cues sometimes.**

Like I took a year off before going to uni, and worked 3/4 of it and traveled for the rest. I had two part time jobs with a couple short shifts a week. This girl I was sorta friends with (kinda had to be cuz we had a mutual friend), she had a full time job, full blown 40h a week, yet even after I blew a couple grand traveling, I **STILL** came out ahead of her at the end of the year. Like where the fuck did the money go!?!?!?!
Using the oversampler vst plugin, I was able to do this A/B test very nicely. Here's a raw bounce of a very simple project I made to exhibit the difference. This has no processing on it whatsoever. Just the raw output of two instances of Largo, alternating, the first using the native project sample rate (44.1) and the latter using oversampler. The synth patch is played in quite a high register so don't start with it too loud for the sake of your ears. It's in the highs where the clarity really comes into play with the oversampling. But it affects almost all patches in some dramatic or subtle way. Note there's no reverb here just the delay from within the plugin, but with the oversampling it sounds like a really lush reverb. The sound stage's spatial depth is dramatically increased as well as the clarity of the high frequency transients. The difference in volume is also only due to sample rate and how it seems to affect how Largo deals with high harmonics. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ [.wav file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/20s5gigprsqlmeu/largo-oversample-ab-test.wav?dl=0) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ [screenshot of project](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b85uybcslwkhgnl/largo-oversample-ab-test-screenshot.png?dl=0)
Yeah. It's definitely not a mandatory right, I'm not even sure that it's useful a lot of the time. Mostly, it is really good against newer players and otherwise good against certain comps.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It's one of those rites that is probably very 'balanced' in the sense of pick rate but is still detracting from the game when it is picked. Like no escape.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ And the weakness of triggering counters is actually kind of counterintuitive to new players. When you are new to the game Riposte seems ridiculous, which all equal counts against it. Starts out noob stompy then becomes noob trappy before finally becoming conditionally a free stun in certain situations. Meh.

Lexi retweeted an article about big-budget action films (which were, no surprise, all directed by men) losing studios money, and made a sarcastic comment about not knowing how these male directors keep getting employed (an allusion to the fact that the reason so few women directors get the big budget movie jobs is that they are told their films don't bring in the cash). Guggenheim, unsolicited, called her a hypocrite/accused her of being sexist, completley missing the point of her tweet, and acting like a self-important, 'but what about men', entitled arse! He also refused to take it back, and continued defending his position after numerous women tried to point out where he was wrong.  Because, obviously, he understands feminism and discrimination on the basis of gender better than those people, they only live it every day of their lives!
You just answered your own question about what they did. :P _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ More crashes = fresher servers, with good integrity. _back_to_line_ Less crashes = more stability, but overloaded servers with crap integrity. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ More than likely just someone triggering a critical error bugs crashing the server.

I moved cross country with a doggo in my WRX. Try doing that in a BRZ... _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Seriously though OP, they're both great cars, just depends on whether you want lightweight/RWD with lower power or AWD and more torque. Go drive both and see which the butt dyno likes better. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ For me personally, the WRX wins because torque, I drive in snowy mountains, and I go to the gun range/farm/around with my dog a lot so the backseat is kind of necessary.
Do you pity them like you do the Viver or do you love them like the Rifters and the WindowsMR guys?
7k effective. Table had just agreed to a round of $25 straddle and I'm first to do it. Utg blind raises $75 before the dealer pitches a card.

&gt;This is not exactly helpful or actionable per se _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ No, I don't think so. Not at all. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I can see how having a significant other would help. Same thing with friends. I do have some friends that are cool with it, but they live far away and I can't see them often. I'd definitely like to make more and surround myself with people who either A) don't care or B) even think it's cool. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The key point here, I think, is that social expectations are entirely subjective and change between groups. In one circle, something that's normally negative could be seen as a positive. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I had a gay friend actually tell me that I should get involved with *queer* circles. I don't get the term because it's so vague and could be applied to anything, and I also hate labels to begin with. BUT, I'd be interested in putting that aside to find accepting people. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The problem is that I kind of live in a conservative area (North Orange County, if you know the SoCal area) and have literally had no friends that you could describe as *queer* for the majority of my life. I wouldn't know where to start, and I imagine I would feel really out of place. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ You wouldn't happen to have advice, would you? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Oh, and thanks for the excellent response.

Preach, sister! _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I am very very active in SD's life and with molding and guiding her, but when I'm feeling overwhelmed, I have the right to say, *God honey, I'm spent.

You have no problem then! You enjoy this games direct competition better than this game!  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ My bet is you have 3 tiers of players when the patch goes live. Level 300's who get all the level 5 cards but never play casual, people who bought the founders pack that have all level 3 cards but are probably in ranked, and everyone else who will have a mix of level 3s and level 1s banging their heads together in casual.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Just the way I see it working out though, who can tell if the player base will be receptive to being herded into ranked or not. However it works out I concur, I hope they figure something out!

I've lived in the same residence for three years paying $700 a month.  The building was bought by someone who put in new management and they raised the rent on, at minimum, ten of us.  I have a 2nd burglary from 6 years ago for smashing my father's deer antlers for making me homeless twice while trying to get a higher education.  I've spent over $200 on applications for a new place to live and I have $2,000 saved up for moving into a new place.  Today is the last day of my rental contract from the old management company and I've been rejected at 6 places because of my record.  Never mind that I maintained a residence for 3 years and have money saved up, my background is an instant disqualifier. 
You can physicaly see who is likely to be a degenerate. Imho they have creepy faces and one cannot see light in their eyes. _back_to_line_ See if you notice that.

No, it's not. None of the countries that went fascist had protection of free speech as i described it. Not Italy, not Spain, not Croatia, not Greece, not Hungary etc., none of them did. Fascism happens when you stifle free speech, not the other way around, and when you have a culture of silencing opposition.

Well that's wrong, they did see play. Bone are saw play in Murloc Paladin which was top tier and Scalebane saw less play but was still there. But let's assume they didn't see play. Then they would have been bard cards. They wouldn't have become good cards without the nerfs.

But you do admit that it's 2017, right?  It's hard to stay grounded in reality sometimes when everything seems backwards.  Trump is supposed to be the Russian stooge, yet it was Obama who gave Putin the green light to take crimea, it was Obama who let Russia take over in syria, it was Obama who practically shoved our most powerful NATO ally into Putin's waiting arms, it was the Clinton's who received millions from people pushing the corrupt U1 deal, it was Bill that met Putin in his private residence when Russia needed the ok from Hillary, it was the Obama administration.iteration that let Russia get control of a big chunk of our uranium supplies and export it to god knows who,   it was McCain and Clinton's campaign managers that employed manafort, yet they are pushing the Russia narrative.  Manafort has been a conduit to Russian money for years, but only now under trump is he running into problems.  No wonder you don't even know what year it is, very disorienting!
&gt;Its just unfortunate that the latter seems to be more common, the wealthier you get. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ yip reading through your list antidotealy it seems true.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ But there could be a distinction here. I'm not a proponent of working hard to get ahead, but I am a proponent of working effectively hard to get ahead.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Lots of people who make money don't make it by providing greater value to society, they make it by taking advantage of someone, some loophole or injustices, in many cases it requires one to be sociopathic to take advantage of others, hence they have a lot the tendencies on your list.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Being ultra simple I believe if you help a million people to the tune of $1 you have earned $1,000,000 however the vast majority of wealth is not generated this way, if only it was. We live in a world of [maker and taker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX8Od9EL0_0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m7s) world and things are shifting in favor of the makers.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I discovered bitcoin and became fascinated with it because it offered a way for effective people to earn more, and hard working people to be exploited less, and takers to be exposed as worthless parasites.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It seems there is a cataclysmic shift happening, Those who see it as way to get rich are all pushing the BTC chain they are showing there true nature (takers), while those who are here to be more effective and build something are moving to the BCH chain (makers). The makers are selling there BTC and building new things for this new world. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Time will tell but I'm hopeful, I think it's all going to work out and people are going to get what they deserve. not everyone investing in bitcoin is going to make money.

I have to agree, I think it's a fun little episode and Kyon's dialogue makes it but as an introduction to first-timers I just don't think it does the job.

Is it the same feeling you have like when you‚Äôre wanting to jump from a tall height, or push your friend?  There‚Äôs a French term that translates to ‚Äúthe call of the void,‚Äù which basically explains that feeling we get.

&gt; It feels bad to get a LMR for a character you don‚Äôt have a SB for, let alone not have at all or don‚Äôt have a Memory crystal to break level caps for. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; But it‚Äôs in the game anyway. So it must not be such a big issue. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It is in the game, but it still doesn't lock you out behind top tier content for LMRs.  You can always try to pick up another soul break relic the next time they come around for the character.  The most important thing is that they can still use abilities for the school they want.  That's the difference in my opinion.  What you are proposing does lock the abilities behind top tier content.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ This is like you get the Blue Mage Ultra from the draw but you still can't use it until you beat magicites.  Even if another event comes around with more relics for that character, you still can't use Blue Magic because it is locked behind magicite. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; That‚Äôs why I say it‚Äôs an issue but maybe not really THAT big an issue to where it‚Äôs just out-and-out a bad idea.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I like your proposed system but I do not think they should be tied to our current magicite.  I think that if they would use your proposed system it should be something for Blue Mages specifically (like a new Blue Mage magicite of some kind or enemy skill materia whatever you want to call it that you can learn the abilities from with your proposed system) but not locked behind top tier content as it currently is. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ As a mentor, I've had plenty of newbies ask me, *I pulled Onion Knight BSB!  I've read on the sub this SB is amazing!  Now what do I do?*.  Then I had to crush their dreams telling them about how the BSB is totes awesomesauce, but that they can't really use it fully because they need Onion Motes and 3 and 4 star motes to unlock it.  This isn't an issue now since they just added the Onion Motes to Fat Chocobo store but from 4-5 months ago it has been a pretty frequent issue.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It would basically turn every Blue Mage we have that needs to unlock the school into like what Onion Knight has for his dive.  Onion Knight is super gimp without his Onion Motes and 4 star dive to access his skills.  It's kind of the same deal.  You're proposing that every Blue Mage be locked out of their skills until you beat top tier content.  Most of the Blue Mage characters are already lackluster because they don't have that needed school.  Locking them out of it from the start isn't a good idea in my opinion.  Any newbie who pulls Onion Knight BSB is like *YEAH! WOOHOO!* until they look and see that Onion Knight is gimp as hell until you unlock his skills.  Then they have to go get 3 and 4 star motes for him just to be able to use him, etc....  Your system is basically turning every Blue Mage into Onion Knight until you beat Magicites.  :/

Bitcoin teaches us all once again that great things can still be made from something that was created by drugs and criminal activity.

This episode has some interesting behind-the-scenes tidbits. The series director for the 2006 series, Yutaka Yamamoto (Yamakan), thought about putting another episode first once the achronological order was decided, but since the *super director* was Haruhi, Yamakan felt that she'd put her own film as the first episode. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The episode itself was written (script), storyboarded, and directed by Yamakan himself. However, the assistant director for the episode is also well known. It's Masaharu Watanabe, the director for the Re:Zero anime adaptation. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Yamakan came from a film school background and focused on the composition, thus it feels like a student-directed film because he directed *Squadron Resentment* during that time period (I'll bring this up at a later episode). He mentioned that there were a lot of days that he couldn't draw storyboards due to the pressure once he said he'd handle this episode (and it being the first one broadcast).

Ok so I'll definitely give you that, the demand will be higher than the supply 100%.

They aren't expensive at all though. A standard Fob that will work with most of these systems is around $8.

Through talking to the new supers I found out the old super was just pocketing the deposit money. The property management company had no idea he was asking for the deposits and most tenants forgot about it when they moved out since it was never documented anywhere.

[Radiation hardening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hardening) developed for use in space is pretty effective, but a big part of why modern electronics aren't particularly vulnerable is simply because the electrical connections are too tiny for an EMP to induce enough current to cause damage. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ [EMPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_nuclear_explosion#EMP_generation) would have the greatest effect on large electrical devices like above-ground power lines and transformers.

It was god awful I went into tech instead.  It's because it is a male dominated industry where people yell at each other to get things done.  If you are a huge guy who loves being an asshole you might like it.  I think most other trades are superior.... HVAC/electrical/plumbing
FL/GA/IA - Trader Joe‚Äôs is great store with fairly cheap on some to most of their items. It‚Äôs also cheap as heck when you look at the way some of the foods are made. For example, most of the foods my fianc√© and I buy are corn free (she‚Äôs allergic to corn). This limits what we can buy premade, so finding the a &lt;fruit&gt; walked into a bar bars that don‚Äôt have corn, at a fairly cheap price, is awesome. They are the only place so far that we have found marshmallows she can eat (Yay rice krispy treats are back in my diet).  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ All in all I‚Äôd say they are at a good value to cost price point. Yes stuff is more than Walmart probably, but then again look at the crap that is sold at Walmart. $5 coffee vs organic fair trade coffee at $8-9. Also three buck chuck, come on, it‚Äôs damn decent wine for $3.
He wasn't and never was. The NFL just enjoys fucking us and this is just more evidence. Mark has been trying to clean up the image from what I understand, and while I get that, he shouldn't let this go. He should get in people's faces until they overturn this suspension. Who the fuck is going to want to risk a paycheck playing for us if this shit keeps happening? If we had been the pats, the NFL probably would have expelled Talib from the league.

Yup. This is the only real solution for those heli missions. 1000m up and over to the drop then 1000k down.
It kinda varies by division and contract. As far as getting holidays off, when I‚Äôm scheduling my store during holiday weeks I accommodate day off requests only when I can, and always in order of seniority. I put a big emphasis on ‚Äúa request is only a request and not guaranteed‚Äù, and make sure all my associates know it. I can‚Äôt speak for other stores in other divisions, but generally if I communicate the ‚Äúrules‚Äù nobody is disappointed or upset when they see the schedule.

Not to mention, if you're going to be working out a lot, you must eat properly so you have the energy to get in a solid workout.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I know a few ppl who are new to the gym and they're sometimes feeling tired, sometimes not, and it turns out they weren't eating enough at all before going to the gym and they had no energy! It is important to eat WELL, enough so that you have the energy to work your body out, atleast.

I posted this above: _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ This car succeeds at making you look rich and fails at just about everything else. It looks good and sounds good. The pros stop there. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Cons:   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ * Reliability. I'm not one to ever bitch about reliability. I do all of my own work, I currently daily drive a 9 second C6 and I'm mechanically inclined while also being able to understand that shit just breaks. The Maserati is interesting in the sense that nothing important ever breaks, but you are constantly plagued by mild and expensive annoyances. The biggest one in my mind: the seat levers. Fuck those things. The levers you pull to move up the front seats so you can access the rear seats are made of plastic and in my one year time of owning the car I broke 7 of them. They're $75 each. $525 on seat levers. This is the trend with the whole interior. The leather is fake and is glued down all over the car, so by the end of the year even though it was garage kept, the leather was bubbling all over the dash from the glue failing. Everything, EVERYTHING inside is made of plastic and will eventually snap or break on you. Mechanically the car was fine except for a radio problem I had where a wire was loose and my radio cut out entirely. I also had a very lovely and uncommon issue where the trunk wouldnt open. I pulled the emergency trunk release in the rear seat area and the emergency cable ripped right out. I had to take it to the dealership for warranty work where they had to cut the trunk off and put a new one on.   _back_to_line_    _back_to_line_ * It has nothing going for it.    _back_to_line_ Speed? No. A 2012 granturismo does 0-60 in 5.3 seconds. A ford truck can do that. 5.3 seconds is pathetic for a car which costs $120k new, looks like this one does, and is advertised as a GT car.    _back_to_line_ Reliability? Not at all.   _back_to_line_ Practicality? The battery dies after 3 days of sitting, the rear seats have no room, and if you drive it too much it will fall apart. If you get the convertible, the top will absolutely begin to leak no matter what you do.   _back_to_line_ Features? Oh my god. To give you an idea of how horrible designed the infotainment is, they call bluetooth *telematics*. Everything is unintuitive and horrible. Maybe you can find a video on youtube of the 2012 Granturismos infotainment. It is the worst I have used in my entire life. Even after a few months of ownership I was fumbling around in that thing trying to figure out how to access certain menus. I cannot stress enough how horrible the infotainment is. None of this is hyperbole, it is probably one of the worst ever put into a vehicle in the history of the world. _back_to_line_ So whats left? Nothing. It sucks. For $120k new you can buy literally any other car and have something better. Even if all you want in the world is to appear rich, you can just buy a Ferrari 360 for that and save money. Spoiler: Most people dont know what this car even is. I had more than one person ask me what kind of Mazda I had. _back_to_line_

See that's totally true. However, trying to approach incels on their own subreddits or forums is like approaching clansmen at a KKK rally. It's just not going to happen. Their *tribe* or idealological group is going to be there and they'll just protect eachother with a bunch of insults and stuff. However, when you get a KKK member on their own and try to talk to them about race, and about exactly why they feel a certain way, they'll many times end up renoucning their old beliefs and leaving the KKK, and we've seen this happen hundreds of times. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ When was the last time you heard of a KKK member resigning because of a really eventful rally, or from someone of political power calling them a degenerate. Never, because that doesn't happen. The opposition just strengthens them and gives them stuff to rally against.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ How we'd go about doing this with incels, I don't fuckin know. But I think it's something we need to consider doing collectively.

&gt; anyone is expecting us to be doing any better than we are. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I think the main problem is, we are mid table right now mainly because other teams have been heavily underperforming. I look at the teams like Everton, West Ham, Swansea and to a certain extent (Palace), these teams should be above us given how much they spent and the quality they've got. Meanwhile we've lost all of our 'winnable' games to Brighton, Huddersfield, Burnley, Bournemouth (whom all according to the link u provided, have squad values less than us). _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Its only a matter of time before fortunes starts to change for West Ham, Everton etc given their spending and come January I imagine they will spend even more to keep their status. Im worried come the relegation battle, these losses will come to haunt us later on.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Also, the excuse of not spending enough or cant compete with the likes of team x/y/z looks bad when Burnley, Brighton and Huddersfield are doing well for themselves in the PL.

I don't have a problem, obviously you are offended.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I didn't mean to offend anyone.

LET IT GO BRO.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ So...sorry if I offended you, I don't see it as a huge issue. It is just a phrase. 
So, if I understand what you're saying, you only get *gold* mana if the ability literally says *mana of any color* with no conditions. You don't get it for an ability that gives you mana from a set of colors, even if that set was all of the colors at the time that the ability resolves. You also don't get it if a source could produce mana of any color, but with separate abilities. If source A produces *gold* mana, and the mana that source B generates depends on the mana that source A generates or could generate, source B does **not** generate *gold* mana. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ In other words, it is a property of mana implicitly decided based on the precise wording of the ability that produced it, and it is not covered by the type, source, or any explicit riders, all of which already have to be accounted for.

In the tiniest of nutshells, Dolezal has been rigorously defending Classical Theism, especially the doctrine of Divine Simplicity and all it implies. Frame thinks that revisions need to made in order to handle all the Biblical data, including allowing some sort of mutability in God. Many have argued things like that, but sort of on the Reformed fringes (e.g., Bruce Ware), but looks like Frame going after Dolezal has ignited the Reformed folks newly found zeal for classical doctrines of God.

It's not weird at all. Lots of girls get to know their partner through work. They could be seeing them day to day for 6 months and have the hots for them.

Volume 12 is out and being translated. According to the author we only have 13 and 14 left. 12 pretty much continued the story and not provide much closure like many thought but overall people liked it. Although some people did get a better understanding in regards to there relationship with 8man.

Laws are enforced by courts and police. Most ancaps believe in civil courts that practice common law. A state is by definition a criminal institution and antithetical to law.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Ancaps generally argue we should have many private courts and police that are run for profit, but they would all recognize and follow common laws and legal norms, usually through a shared legal philosophy and emphasis on precedent.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ We also favor civil law over criminal law, so instead of a third party enforcing their statutes legal trials should only settle disputes between two indivdiuals. 
I've hated having Time Warner, but I've never had a bad experience with Grande. Also, they offer a 200MB option that's cheaper than Google's gigabit (which is a bit overkill for my use cases)

Ohhh man. I‚Äôve never fired a M14, but I‚Äôve seen some reviews and apparently it‚Äôs pretty bad.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ For the Scar H I‚Äôve test fired it and it‚Äôs AMAZING. If you‚Äôve got the money, GET IT. The only downside it‚Äôs really expensive. It‚Äôs about 375 on Evike, but it‚Äôs probably cheaper on KYAirsoft. Plus mags are 60!  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ MP7, super solid so far. I‚Äôm probably going to mod the internals soon once I get paid.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ An overarching thing about WE GBB guns is that you should be prepared for maintenance and modification. Out of the box they should be fine and skirmishable for a few days, but you‚Äôre going to have to upgrade certain parts/ and or replace if you‚Äôre in it for the long run. Then these guns become soooo fun, satisfying, and reliable. The only guns I haven‚Äôt changed internals for are the pistols and for my ACR. Be prepared to troubleshoot and stuff too haha. Hope this helps

Not too worried about Lukas mental state. Kid looked like Slovenia‚Äôs best player at times, even with Dragic on the court, during EuroBasket. He shoots at high clip. Can distribute.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The kid made his debut in Liga ACB, which is the 2nd best league in the world behind the NBA, at the age of 16.  Again, not extremely worried about his mental state or him gettin shook in big games.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ We‚Äôve never really seen a euro prospect like him before tbh just cuz he is so versatile.

I expect that people will bend rules all the time - which is perfectly fine there's not a Hot Stopper Police State.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Because the other issue will be that Brady and Grey won't want to count out specifically 4096 Hot Stoppers every time.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ But if you end up with twenty or thirty less than you should have.... I don't think anyone's going to worry too much about that in terms of lost resources.

Chalk = cress, heatran, amoonguss, lando (usually therian) and kang _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ And for ur team concerns, u should have various ways of playing your team. Adding slow pokemon and a tr setter is one way of doing so. This way ure not relying so heavily in a single strat, which in this case is offense.   _back_to_line_ This will make some things easier at bo3s, since if one thing didnt work u can try another, make adjustments etc. 
Well, I can only speak for myself but given the value of the data I can get from it its worth the risk rather than sitting at home.  If it's that much of an issue you can always get Apple Care and never have to worry.  
Thanks! I am still working on the UI all the time and yeah it could use a few tweaks. What were you thinking? I'm open to any feedback!  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I've definitely got a *tweener* plan in the works. I have a restricted database that only has a few tickers in it, or I can also take the full one with almost 10k symbols and restrict the amount of data you can see, so early next year I'll be rolling out a cheaper plan that only has 5-7 years of data and leaves some more complex features out. At some point in the future I'll probably have a free *preview* type of plan also but at this point in time literally the only reason I haven't implemented it is because the logic to handle what people can/can't see is pretty complex since the site has so many features. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Also, in the very near future (maybe after the new year) I plan to start doing a weekly or semi-monthly live stream on youtube using the site to do analysis of stuff decided from my twitter following and probably here on reddit too! I used to do a weekly technical analysis and charting video in /r/stockmarket but I got really busy with building this site and just didn't have time to do it anymore. So anyway, I want to bring that back except now we can look at technicals AND fundamentals. I was thinking it would be cool if each week we all pick a stock from the previous week that's been super hot in the news or whatever and dig into it and try to find red flags and hidden gems. Doing that on youtube for an hour each week would be really educational and super fun!  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Anyway thanks for the thoughts and feedback, I just pushed the price changes up so it's now $199.95/yr ($16.66/month) til Dec 31 and then it will go to the final pricing and i'll start working on rolling out the other plans and new features hopefully before Jan 31st. So far so good! _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Cheers!

It's based on monster settings. A monster whose sets are Violent/Any would value a violent slot 1 rune exactly as much as they'd value an energy slot 1 rune with the exact same stats. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Since most of your mons are not going to be set to allow *any* set, a violent rune will on average have better rankings than an energy rune since more monsters can use it.
True. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Edit: It was a Christmas present though.

It sounds like it should be awesome for you? At the same time it does not sound like the game for you, you seem to want to change that games course from its original outset.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Splitting solo and groups would incur far longer matchmaking times, you would rather sit and wait 10mins each raid?

Like I said, I really do think she's the best red for a flier team. She'll treat you well!  A word of caution though, she's had Wo Dao for a long time now, but she only started excelling with it once I got her speed over 40.
Yeah. That pack in your photo looks legit, just the prior version.
That is a BPD responce. I have done something like that but not to that extent. I stole my friends phone so she would come visit me by making out i grabbed it leaving for class.  She knew the truth but understands my illness. She tells me i wouldn't be me without it. But yeah we all have the abandonment fear. It stems from when the illness started developing in childhood we had someone we loved abandon us and we never van shake that feeling without alot of therapy. Best advice i can give you for your friend is be there for her. Be kind and be understanding. While it might be annoying on your side within her she might not have the ability to say what she needs from yourself or others.

Ah sorry misunderstood that. It will perform better for sure but I can't give you any numbers. You should look for some benchmarks :)
&gt;Its because people who pay for the game should be able to atleast see the content in it. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I don't really agree. I played a ton of final fantasy when I was a kid, must've been 5-7 different games. Never finished a single one because I was too scrub, loved it anyway. I think I can count with one hand the number of games I have on steam where I can definitely say that I can exercise my *right* to see all content, because it has a easybabby-mode. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Don't have time to play 15 hours a day for about 3 months? Too bad, you'll never be rank14. Doesn't mean you can't hit rank11 and have a blast on the way, meet some awesome people and maybe help them on their journey to 14. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Don't want to/have time to farm consumables? Too bad, you'll never be part of the cutting edge progression scene. Doesn't mean you can't be in the guild, share their experience and move in for sloppy seconds. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ There are sooo many different parts of this game where this holds true. How many people have seen a Rivendare mount drop? Participated in the TF questline/events? The opening of AQ? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ This game isn't designed like hellokitty funland where everyone is always equal and effort doesn't mean shit, and imo it shouldn't be. People just need to accept that there is nothing standing in the way of you loving to play Classic even if you will never reach R14, never kill Kel'thuzad or even C'thun for that matter. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;I see LFR more as a cinematic about the lore than as a raid. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Few cinematics have rewards with that kind of iLvl though. I'd have literally 0 problem with LFR entirely if the iLvl just matched mythic dungeons instead of being a stepping stone towards normal

Throwback to that crowdfunding effort to buy his vote.

No, The US have historically vetoed all attempts to establish Palestine's statehood. Even as a non-UN observer state, the US were 1 of the 9 countries that voted against, while 138 states voted for. And that policy is certainly not going to change when the new guy in the oval office strongly considers moving the US embassy to Jerusalem. 
I don't think they're going to kiss in the show(though I definitely wouldn't be opposed to it), but I do **really** want at least one good scene, dare I say a whole episode like The Honorable Ones, where it's just Sabine and Ezra having a good long talk. Make it while they're in the process of doing something else, like how Kallus and Zeb were trying to escape and survive the ice cave, if they need to have it move the plot forward, but I really want them to have some actual on screen quality time together where they're by themselves, not actively engaged in battle, and have a chance to really talk and reflect on how they and their relationship has changed. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I really wanted their scenes in Flight of the Defender to be such a case, and the trailer certainly made it look like it might be. But alas, it was a fake out and they didn't really have any moments like that. I really hope the writers give us at least one long solid quality Sabine and Ezra heart to heart scene before the series is over. 
They're growing hair.

You're talking about expanding the DMV as a whole, however, and that would be incredibly costly and almost impossible for some cities, as they lack the space or the funds to do so.

Irresistible Dance...lemme refresh my memory on it, exactly. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;Choose one creature that you can see within range. The target begins a comic dance in place - shuffling, tapping its feet, and capering for the Duration. Creatures that can't be Charmed are immune to this spell. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;A dancing creature must use all its Movement to dance without leaving its space and has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and Attack rolls. While the target is affected by this spell, other creatures have advantage on Attack rolls against it. As an action, a dancing creature makes a Wisdom saving throw to regain control of itself. On a successful save, the spell ends. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ So he wastes his turn standing still, so it'd be easy enough to touch him (though you might have to roll a sort of touch-attack? Which is fucking suicide), and Goku has to choose between attempting to break out, or dancing in place. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Unfortunately he can just laser the wizard, so rip us. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ How are his wis/int saves?

Fair enough. For the same reason I could see Pearce doing well at Newcastle, anything not last will be good for them. Hayne will be in amongst a great roster as well so should have less pressure.

Also im keeping what ive been told is op or to much ram for future upgrading also i hear you can overclock ram? Also everything is from newegg so i can get all in one warranty. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ [PCPartPicker part list](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/hPBP2R) / [Price breakdown by merchant](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/hPBP2R/by_merchant/) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Type|Item|Price _back_to_line_ :----|:----|:---- _back_to_line_ **CPU** | [Intel - Core i7-8700K 3.7GHz 6-Core Processor](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/sxDzK8/intel-core-i7-8700k-37ghz-6-core-processor-bx80684i78700k) | $415.98 @ Newegg  _back_to_line_ **CPU Cooler** | [Noctua - NH-D15 SE-AM4 140.2 CFM CPU Cooler](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/shNypg/noctua-nh-d15-se-am4-1402-cfm-cpu-cooler-nh-d15-se-am4) |- _back_to_line_ **Memory** | [Corsair - Vengeance LPX 16GB (2 x 8GB) DDR4-3000 Memory](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/MYH48d/corsair-memory-cmk16gx4m2b3000c15) | $196.99 @ Newegg  _back_to_line_ **Storage** | [Samsung - 850 EVO-Series 500GB 2.5* Solid State Drive](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/FrH48d/samsung-internal-hard-drive-mz75e500bam) | $149.99 @ Newegg  _back_to_line_ **Storage** | [Seagate - Barracuda 2TB 3.5* 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/KyCwrH/seagate-internal-hard-drive-st2000dm001) | $126.99 @ Newegg  _back_to_line_ **Video Card** | [Asus - GeForce GTX 1080 Ti 11GB STRIX GAMING Video Card](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/Yr8H99/asus-geforce-gtx-1080-ti-11gb-video-card-strix-gtx1080ti-11g-gaming) | $764.98 @ Newegg  _back_to_line_ **Case** | [Phanteks - Enthoo Pro M Tempered Glass (Black) ATX Mid Tower Case](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/2mQRsY/phanteks-enthoo-pro-m-tempered-glass-atx-mid-tower-case-ph-es515ptg_bk) | $109.98 @ Newegg  _back_to_line_ **Power Supply** | [EVGA - SuperNOVA G2 750W 80+ Gold Certified Fully-Modular ATX Power Supply](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/MfJwrH/evga-power-supply-220g20750xr) | $77.98 @ Newegg  _back_to_line_ **Other**| Auros ultra gaming motherboard| $139.99  _back_to_line_  | *Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts* | _back_to_line_  | Total (before mail-in rebates) | $2002.88 _back_to_line_  | Mail-in rebates | -$20.00 _back_to_line_  | **Total** | **$1982.88** _back_to_line_  | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2017-12-01 00:16 EST-0500 |

Being able to chain a WAV track into another aux, &amp; another aux track, basically limitless. You could have one vocal chain processed through multiple channels to get a crisp clean sound. I've tried doing the same thing in Logic and it's just not the same. For one logic has a limit where you couldn't bus seperate channels into one aux track, and then bus that aux into a completely separate channel
Sure thing on anything done in the pledge process that achieves all of the benefits you listed that is not hazing. Hazing is actually defined as harassment, humiliation, or abuse that is used to initiate people into a group.

Why go through all of that just to get friends, ‚Äúfun‚Äù, and trust from the fraternity?

I don't think the natural thing is an actual excuse. I think it's just something she males up on the spot to cover for the fact that she's not taking care of herself because these depressed.

That's correct. However, the LuLaRoe company doesn't give two craps whether or not they're consultants can actually sell their inventory. That's because the consultants have already purchased the inventory from LuLaRoe. LuLaRoe already has its money, so they don't care whether or not the consultant can sell her goods.

She's at least been speaking out about it when it's happened in her party -- namely against Moore and Trump.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I'm no Comstock supporter -- I'm against a lot of other policy positions she does hold -- but it's disingenuous to claim she hasn't been setting a precedent regarding sexual assault unless she's been actively voting against policies that benefit sexual assault victims and refusing to comment on actions by those even in her party. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Edit: _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I did want to start looking into this, and a quick search shows an arguably checkered history (especially once you mix in her views of abortion into the mix).

We talk all about our business and the decisions we take risks on to try to grow to sustainability!

Bruce is an absolute legend and one of the best artists I've ever seen live.

I'd point out that the LD50 ratio for alcohol between average drink and lethal dose is 10. Average dose is 2 drinks. 20 will kill you if you take it in quick succession. LD50 of 28 is quite a bit higher. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ And again codeine is very weak. It's the weakest opioid out there. Can't get any weaker than that. It produces a partial dose ceiling roof past a certain dose through 2D6 inhibition, which blocks codeine metabolising to morphine. Those who become regular users find it hard to overdose because of it. Occasional acute users however don't benefit from the same level of tolerance buildup and are at greater risk.

It's treating gun imagery like cool accessorizing, basically. Without knowing the specific reference (and honestly, even in-context), it strikes me as tasteless.

I think that's over optimistic, fly still failed to reach the lcs with gcu and I'd put him bottom half of mids. Additionally, AnDa and stunt both have very little lcs experience and flame and fly are both Korean and have only had about a year to learn English, so this team may have some communication issues. I'd say they might make 5-6 seed but i wouldn't be expecting much more out of them until this team has more time to gain experience and strengthen its communication.
If they implement cosmetic only crates, they‚Äôll be making more money than if they kept them how they are now. I say they‚Äôre greedy pieces of shit and only care about money because of how they‚Äôve handled the whole situation. They took micro transactions out just to boost sales then they‚Äôre going to add them back and just milk us for all we‚Äôre worth. The way the game is set up now, it‚Äôs all focused toward making us buy loot crates. You don‚Äôt get many good things from daily crates, normal crates cost way too much for what‚Äôs in them, and crafting parts are very scarce. Also, Hearthstone is a card game right? All card games, even in real life are pay to win, so I‚Äôm not sure how you can make that argument work in this situation. 
The adult thing to do is acknowledge responsibility and adjust yourself. I think the CAF as a whole has done that.

Choosing to befriend decent people should reduce the likelihood they‚Äôll steal from me. If I do everything reasonable to protect my credit card information, I‚Äôll be less likely to be victimized than someone who uses their credit card indiscriminately online, and doesn‚Äôt monitor their monthly statements or their credit history. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt believe we‚Äôll ever get to a point where predators looking to take advantage of others will cease to exist. I wasn‚Äôt suggesting if every woman in the world did the right thing nothing bad would ever happen. I‚Äôm aware a lot of women are assaulted despite doing everything to avoid it. Preventative measures won‚Äôt eliminate all assaults, but they could reduce the number of them. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unreasonable to want to reduce the number of women being assaulted. Obviously, more can and should be done by men to change they way they treat women. The current spate of predator outings in the entertainment, news, and political arenas will hopefully usher in a new a approach by men at home, in public, at school, and on the job.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ In regards to the Weinstein mess, I do think some of the women made poor decisions. This doesn‚Äôt excuse him for being a third rate piece of shit. It was an open secret in the industry he was a scum bag. Some of the victims went to meet him despite warnings from others. Some went to his hotel room late at night for meetings. Some entered his room after he answered the door in a bathrobe. Some let him into their homes after he‚Äôd assaulted them previously. He was surrounded by people who tolerated his actions, hid his secrets, and enabled his disgusting behaviour. A lot of these people were men, some of them were women. They were primarily focused on their own best interests and not the interests of the women being victimized. Ultimately, far too many women were assaulted and far too few people did anything to prevent it or stop it.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ For further clarity... My comments aren‚Äôt intended to suggest women are at fault for being assaulted. The act of assaulting another person is solely the responsibility of the person committing the assault. However, if you make it easier to be a victim by putting yourself in harms way that‚Äôs on you. It doesn‚Äôt make the responsibility anywhere near equal but it is a factor. Whether some of these women thought the risk was worth it career wise, or they were just naive, they walked into the proverbial lion‚Äôs den.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ For the record, I‚Äôm far harsher on people who get roped into phishing scams. People have been getting warned for far too long about not clicking on suspicious links, providing banking information, or sending money to people online to still be falling for this nonsense. I have no sympathy for people get duped by these scams.

I'm fearful that's the case (that kratom isn't for me) :(. I included more details in my edit above. May I ask if you have found anything that works for you? Thanks for your response! 
I can't really give you the answers because they will be unique to you. I know that in my own self-improvement, it was about overcoming a lot of fears holding me back. I'd see an event, but I'd tell myself some reason why the event wasn't for me or was too intimidating.  I gradually started pushing myself to go to events that scared me, and pushing past my excuses.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It's up to you to pick events to go to.  I went to board game Meetups, religious/cultural events, joined folk dance communities, a random neighborhood poker group, and made more of an effort to invite people to hang out, even if it was just Netflix.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Each new thing was a struggle for me, and each ended being way less intimidating when i actually showed up. I also made it a policy to go to anything I was invited to. I have zero interest in poker, but a friend invited me to their group, so I went and loved it and the group turned into some of my closest friends. The folkdancing group I got into because a coworker invited me to their group.  Showing up to that was terrifying, I really had to force myself to go, but once I went I immediately fell in love with it and made an instant group of friends.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I bet if you went to Meetup.com, you would find events that appeal to you. There are beer-tasting groups, and groups that go to films and concerts together. You could also find a group that does something random that you've never done before, like sailing or something, and just show up and try it out.  
I agree, Net Neutrality is a good thing and the government intervening in this instance is necessary. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I see what you were saying now about the libertarian meme :P _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Don't believe everything you hear, especially if it comes from a meme.

Not for you or anyone else to decide who is or isn't a real Christian based on what they believe about abortion. And it's not twisting Scripture to believe that a genetically and physiologically unique living being is deserving of the same protection as one that is well developed enough to live outside the mother's womb. It's debatable, certainly, but not even close to qualifying as misuse of Scripture.

Ye it's really weird that her new CD reduction talent for z boosters requires to be in siege mode and to hit heroes to work. My unwritten #1 rule for Hammer is: Never siege if your boosters are on cooldown. Yet if you want any value from that talent you'll have to take huge risks by sieging up. 
You might not have been following the routine properly. Or maybe it just wasnt for you. Ive done and still do low carb. I have a ton of energy when I have transitioned over, not so much when I have gone off and and moving back to low carb. I work a fast paced job, have for years. When im going back to low carb from a few days off, the entire next few days are terrible, but once Im back on, I easily do my tasks. But again, maybe it just doesnt work for you. But depending on the OP's needs and diet, it is at least worth him checking into, even if just at a glance.

That's why I do my homework. Some dems are less critical of gun laws. Honestly, I just wish a Libertarian I could trust would have the publicity as one of our two dominant parties. For the most part libertarians, at least the ones I read about, what some restrictions like: longer wait periods, felons are not allowed, more thorough background checks... All things I can get behind. But the thing is, if I wanted to I can go to the ghetto spend a couple hundred and get a 9mm semi-automatic. Gun laws don't apply to those who don't care.

I used to love SAS back when it was mostly posting pictures poking fun at Walmart scooters, Bible beaters, Concealed carry rocker launchers etc. It was like what r/MURICA was back before it became too much of a circlejerk.

No, it's not a good analogy because the rates of abusive gay people is way smaller than the amount of corrupt cops. I'm not talking about the proper use of force. I'm talking about high amounts of rape and racist violence. Don't deflect from that. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If you want people to see cops differently, change cops. Because what you're doing right now is confirming every negative belief I have about them and their unwillingness to admit wrong doing and desire to cover up for one another. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Be a loud and proud gay when you're a cop.

Thanks for pointing that out! I've noticed it before, but I still think what he's saying is good and applies to this situation as much as all the other (mostly middle eastern) examples he discusses. I mean who else is even talking about these topics in this way? Seems like most criticism of identity politics is coming from the right (but really only offering their own warmed over identity politics from the past). Yassin al-Haj Saleh spent time in prison for being a communist, so I think it would be harder for mainstream identity politics loving left to dismiss him when he calls it into question. You have to work with what you've got, heh.
They did have N. K. Jemisin's Stone Sky on the list, so they're not totally crazy. It's the conclusion to a great sci-fi/fantasy trilogy. While I haven't read all the Sci-fi/fantasy written in 2017 to definitively say it was one of the year's best, I can say it was pretty good.

I recently started a new account so I could continue to play with my real friends (who only plays when they're at home, while I play at work and at home) who rarely get put in Bad Sport (while my main account recently got 128 days/4+ months), and the absolute only thing I really needed to be back to 100% fun level with the fresh account was a bunker, MOC, Oppressor, Explosive Sniper rounds and Oppressor missiles. 150 USD (including PS+) later and I had a completely clean account with all of the above at rank 1. It took me literally under 22 hours of gameplay to have that new account get Bad Sport banned for 2 days. Simply because I blew up too many cars belonging to other players. In a game called Grand Theft Auto. If you think I'm alone in paying for another account, think again. The players in Bad Sport lobbies are all just like me. Old, lots of disposable income and lots of free time to play. Bad Sport players are literally funding the development of GTAO and the casual player don't even know that this huge other *community* of players exist. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ That said, I prefer Bad Sport freeroam (as long as my RL friends arent online). Less chance of someone shooting you through a wall with the thermal optics helmet glitch (dunce cap can't be removed, so no helmet for you, bur thermal scope is still possible), and thats where it's always action 24/7. It's like two completely different games. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I know this will get downvoted. I don't care. It's something no one seemingly knows or talks about publically when whining about Shark Cards.
You can do a twist where the guy you thought was the big bad turns out to not actually be bad, but when you do that you have to actually replace them with a better villain.  Killian didn't feel like a better villain.  First off there wasn't much of a twist to his reveal as the true mastermind since the audience already knew he was a bad guy.  He was just the secondary villain, and even after the main villain turned out to be a red haring he never stopped feeling like a secondary villain. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Really if they were going to make it work they should have stuck with the original idea, and have Maya Hansen turn out to be the real mastermind. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Another issue was that he had the same exact power as his minions.  We were never really given a reason for why he was harder to beat.  We were just expected to believe it.  They could have at least given him something to explain why he was stronger.  Like maybe give him rings that *focus* his power.

I wouldn't call Hughes ma-and-pa. That would be something like Fidelity in Rolla (I still have PTSD from dealing with them when I was in college). Their parent company, Echostar used to own Dish Network and still builds their satellites, not exactly something a ma-and-pa ISP does. Ma-and-pa companies don't build shit and launch it into orbit. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Hughes is shit because satellites are shit for internet connection. They're better than dial up if you live in the middle of nowhere, and better than nothing if you're on a boat or in a plane, and but they can't break the laws of physics and offer a low latency connection that's good for gaming, VOIP, Skype, etc. There is no reason for anyone who can get any sort of land based broadband connection to choose satellite. Even an LTE modem from one of the major 4 mobile providers would be preferable to satellite. Satellite internet is really for people who literally have no other option.
There's also the fact that you would be some kind of immortal being that rules over your nation forever.

Oh. It's actually surpringing to be honest with you. Given to how big the Persona community (and by extension,this subreddit) is i thought it actually did have it's own server. I will be sure to check out the P5 server,although since P5 is one of the games i've yet to play i tried to not check it. Perhaps they have separate channels for the other games. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Thanks for the reply! i hope that if the demand is there,this sub gets it's own official Discord!
Eh... I'm glad you've prospered from it and I hope you keep doing so. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I think the stock market can compare, though. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ My investment in nVidia alone comes close enough to bitcoin-level gains for me. Sure, it's taken me 2 years to gain as much as Bitcoin has in 1 but the myriad of additional benefits make the slower growth worthwhile.
You could argue they lose money if they don't help the hacking victims, since if they stop playing they lose another customer.

We know that three were of Numenorean race from the Akallabeth in the Silmarillion. However, they aren't Black Numenoreans, because that's not a term that is used until many hundreds of years after the Nazgul appear (let alone when they must have been given their Rings).
Yeah, you are correct in that the kb isn't backlit--that was what my question was referring to. I just like the caps for the price. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If you (or anyone else reading this) can recommend some non-backlit PBT caps around the same price point, I'm definitely interested!

I was under the impression that it was alright to say *queer* if you yourself were gay. I don't know anymore. I'm just glad that most of the people I spend my time with couldn't care less, and the gay people I know are fairly easy going and can tell the difference between someone trying to be offensive and someone who's just not clued up on what's the latest acceptable term.

&gt; solving these problems _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ That were created by us* I'm ultimately just going to copy paste my earlier response, because as per always you've shown your utter lack of understanding on something, the ability to handwave any wrongdoing when it's *your side* and pulled your age old *you people paint with a broad brush* as you then proceed to immediately paint with a fucking roller. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ About the only thing that's relevant, or incredibly true about your post is your flair.

I think that's still okay because (in my head) those are mostly old Icathian names given to the void creatures and that those names are more about the formatting of them as opposed to a particular vowel sound or repeated letter.

The reason I figured this bill would pass despite the uproar is when you are saving the wealthy trillions, kicking back millions is just the cost of doing business.
Noticed that since playing with it, my bad.

Look at how expensive new things are in GTA though. If you picked up the game today, you're looking at a MASSIVE grind just to get to the point where you can start farming money at any semblance of a reasonable rate. Most people will just say *eff that* and buy a shark card, becaue it takes less time invested to earn the $20 in real life for a shark card than the however many millions of in-game dollaroos it costs to buy just one of the cool vehicles. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ That's where all *real money* options cripple games. As soon as they implement buying stuff with real money, they have to make things worth spending money on, either by offering *better than default* stuff(Call of Duty) or by making default stuff take forever to earn(Star Wars Battlefront 2) so the *just throw money* option looks better to the average consumer. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ GTA:O pretty much proved that if EA hadn't utilized lootboxes, they could have released BF2 with all of its pay to win garbage and absurd 40 hour grinds for heroes and it would've been fine. Hell, it probably would've been absurdly profitable. In a way I'm glad their hubris got so out of hand the way it did, because things are finally getting observed and dirt bag tactics are being ostracized by pretty much every news outlet and several government bodies so publishers will likely think twice before going whole hog on consumer gouging. For the next couple years anyways. And now we're seeing who the good guys in the industry are(hint: it's not Take Two)
I don't hate them honestly. They're OK. I wonder how many conceptual species already have variations. Like.. Fire monkies. There's simisage, and infernape... Anyone else? hm.
Probably the same feelings you had. When we got to the hospital they immediately put us in a consolation room while they worked on him. That's when it started to really get real.

I was taking online school and was able to work at my own pace. Shit like that sounds like every high schoolers dream, but it really wasn‚Äôt for me. _back_to_line_ I was already behind when I transferred to online learning, they couldn‚Äôt transfer my school files for some unknown reason. I had to redo half a school year‚Äôs worth of work alongside regular daily classes. _back_to_line_ By the time I reached 12th grade, I still had an entire year and a half of work to make up. Decided it was better to drop out and take adult education classes instead of deal with another year+ of struggling.

Yeah it kind of made me mad too. These are just Judgy introverts that are looking down upon other people. You can easily flip the crappy logic with: _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ ...treat you lesser for being friendly when they meet you.* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Those are the people that you tend to notice are super cliquish and EVERYONE is beneath them, but they have almost no friends. They're friends with 2 PEOPLE. That's dangerous territory for me.
I played on Xbox last night and it was noticeably better for me.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Don't get me wrong, there's still flinch.. but it wasn't killing my vibe
If you have to ask, you‚Äôll never know.
You're right! _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ But you used the term, *basic freedoms.* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I don't consider internet access to be a *basic freedom.* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Take care.
Hmmm.... I didn't even really notice this. I just got this thing not an hour ago. It was purchased as B-stock for a deep discount, not a scratch on it and all the original packaging. *Factory blemish?* It looks like the mod wheels were switched with the Deepmind 6? I'm thinking it might have been a production error because the paint hasn't been removed and it doesn't look like its been opened up or tampered with. Interesting! 
Mainly because we can't qualify for a loan right now.  I've also watched Denver boom and bust three times now and I'm not all that old, which makes me very apprehensive of buying a starter home in this market when I won't be able to do anything with it for at least five years.  My wife and I aren't even so sure anymore we'll want to be in the metro area five years from now. 
Yeah, but I also am exposed to normal people on a daily basis, I go places other than just the gym.  I made the comparison to point out I'm not saying it's a matter of attractiveness, I'm saying he isn't that buff and reddit is making him sound like he is.  He looks like he gets a couple hours of working out a week and doesn't eat like shit, that's basically what they recommend as the recommended minimum of exercise for health.  He looks healthy enough to me but he doesn't look fit, especially not in the recent photos.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ And, for what it's worth, when I worked in EMS for 7 years I saw plenty of average people, I'm in doctors offices quite regularly for myself, I was nearly paralyzed earlier this year and in the hospital quite a bit, my point is I see plenty of people who aren't in the best of condition so it's not like I have no concept of what a normal person looks like and I haven't spent so much time in the gym that my mind is warped lol _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The dude looks like he meets general health recommendations
I can't remember the exact subreddit, but someone said something about him and he complained to the mods *if you don't take action i am going to contact the admins*. Biggest pussy on reddit
That's not what i'm saying, my point is the that right now colleges and student loan companies have absolutely zero incentive to produce *fortune 500 CEOs* and at heart they're bussinesses with who's aim is to profit as much as they can. Also by *weeding out earlier on* you put unecessary pressure on kids who, at the age range i imagine you're thinking of really have no clue what they want to do in the future, when i went through my GCSEs i was 16 at the time and the sheer stress of a comparatively minor qualification to what you're suggesting resulted in severe anxiety and depression in about a third of all the friends i had at the time myself included. The thing i'm trying to get at is that there can't be such a simple and idealistic solution as yours to this problem and to be honest there may not be a solution other than the very expensive privitisation of the afformentioned sectors which would likely decrease in a short term but sharp decrease in tax revnue (i'm not sure this may be bullshit just speculation don't quote me on it).
Thanks that was what I was looking for. Increased latency seems unavoidable based on the fundamental design of a mesh network, wasn't sure if there were any techniques for minimizing it.

Hey! Thanks for posting! It's nice to hear from someone in my area. Do you mind if I ask how you found your position? Did you do anything in undergrad that you think helped you get the job anything specific to our area? I know that's a lot sorry. I'm just curious and haven't talked to many people other than professors. 
No, it isn't. He is purposefully backing legislation he *knows* will: blow up the deficit by 1.4T, kick millions off of healthcare, and increase the already insane wealth disparity. And the inevitable outcome of all of that is that thousands of Americans *will* die, and many more will be thrown into poverty. Anyone who backs the GOP tax bill is an enemy of every American who isn't rich.

I truly hope this is not going to be the case. I will be waiting for reviews about not just the game but, if there are any microtransactions before I buy.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I'm getting sick of this shit and have plenty of old games that I can replay for years until these publishers either get their shit together or collapse under the weight of their own greed. 
All 3 probably. They are expanding to more countries in 2022. I believe 48
I agree.
Nothing, I‚Äôve never even seen the guy
Yeah man I agree wholeheartedly
Does he? That's kinda sucky imo if that's true. He reaps vast amounts of reddit points linking community pages most days, if he can do that first because he knows exactly when they are published. This denies those sweet reddit points from the honest  average redditor who has to search for such things.
One that would have fit bowies voice I think would be Welcome to the Machine!

Okay, that's understandable and I agree. But there's a difference, to me, between not liking a character because solely they replaced someone and not liking the character itself, IMO anyway. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Edit: u/Eobard95 understands the difference from his response.

When you mention it, that specific Morgan does bear a resemblance. I'd totally recommend going with it! If you're concerned about if it'll be as quality as you want it to be, don't be.

It will never happen. The pac-12 requires certain seats per stadium, so we would need to build at least a new football stadium and basketball arena. We would also need a lot more donations. I don't even think we have a booster club for sports, most of the pac-12 teams have multiple millionaire boosters that have donated millions of dollars to them over the years. Think Phil Knight in Oregon donating millions each time the university needs something. We should be happy that at least we are D 1.

I just got it from a random guy.
Yeah, probably something to do with him being a top bloke?
&gt;Government has been in bed with every economy. The only reason communism/socialism can even begin to exist is because government enforces it. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The same can be said for capitalism. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;Not exactly sure what you're referring to there. But I propose limiting government power by reducing it's size so much that it has virtually no power. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ How would it be able to enforce anything at that point? Also I'd contend that no matter how little power it has someone will try to abuse it.

Brassy frizz triangle is me.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ My hair's chin-length right now and it just doesn't work with my volume and texture. The big problem is that it's in the no-man's-land between *curly enough to stand up and hold a shape cut into it without the need to part it* and *straight enough to lay flat-ish.* It's not a cloud and it's not yet a bob. Instead it just wants to poof up but still sorta fall to one side. Doesn't matter if my curls are defined or not; it still looks messy and therefore frizzy. I suspect, looking at Alina, that she will have precisely the same problem as me. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I cannot wait until it's shoulder length.

Just malfunction. Something on the inside is probably busted. I'll see if I can repair it at a cheap price at a 3rd party repair shop (Apple services are way too expensive).
Yeah and a sequel was announced Ed to be in the works a day after they released it in China. A studio would make bank of the Chinese if a league movie came out. Would probably get panned in the west though 
they wont sit brouwer. No matter how much sense it makes. Besides. He has been decent. He will be in the lineup. Also, Familton will have to go down to bring up mangiapane so benny is the only option at C. Unless you sit him or jagr and put lazar in
If you're really determined to go down there, you need to find a way to blow large amounts of fresh air in there first.

You should tell them not to follow you down under ANY circumstances. 
I watched the Cybertron Productions youtube channel to learn VGC 2017 tricks and trends regarding teams. Maybe watch a few youtube videos for VGC18 to get a feel for it? 
Yeah I've read that article and it's still crazy. Those charts are obscenely generous to Stanton. The top chart has him finishing his career as the 13th best WAR for position players in the last 50 years. And on that chart, he's still only worth $258m after his opt out. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ In the other chart, which is still optimistic but certainly more realistic, he's only worth $150m after his opt out year. And he's got $243m guaranteed on those years on his current contract. There's just no way he can expect to sign for substantially more than that by opting out
He is the owner of a professional gaming community called faze clan 
To be fair, he didn't mention free and said he was willing to pay for the developer's work.

Looks alright, once you get the grind lines sorted it'll be good. The plunge grind looks a bit mushy but fixable. Like someone else here I am working on a sheepsfoot myself, though rather than the hand grinding I'm trying to work out how to do it properly on a CNC. 
I'd rather they just try and abolish the electoral college. Sorry, but most red states don't deserve to be a campaign stop in presidential elections.

Yeah, it's more of a fun challenge than a competitive run at this point because of all the early access stuff with the constant changes. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It's not like the assassin skip is gonna be in the game for too much longer, and with the stages being jumbled around and added each patch, it seemed to be the simpler solution to the people that wanted to run it anyways. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If there's still runners when the game becomes stable, I imagine real time would be the superior choice.
‚ô´AA^AAA AAAHH!‚ô´
In fact, from having done both at the same time I can tell you what it does. If you take  cocaine on top of MDMA it will stop the effects of the MDMA. Almost instantly.

I think what Carver is doing is using a definition of *liberal* that may or may not conform to ours, but since he makes it clear that he is using this definition, I don't think there's anything to *buy*.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Carver may be wrong about what *liberalism* is, or, at least, his definition may be more simplified or historical than the ones we normally use, but, again, he's clear about what he means by it.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Therefore I don't think it's hard to see his point.

No, but thanks for asking! _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Let's say you get a ransomware alert. Then, as soon as you get the alert, your *contain ransomware* workflow starts running. It blocks outbound traffic from the infected machine and inbound traffic into the machine, disables the user's account, and does a few other actions. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Before, you'd have to wait for a security analyst to see the alert to respond to it. By that time, the ransomware may have taken over your entire network. With Orchestrator, you can automate the initial step in malware response. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Does that make sense?

Thanks for expanding on the situation you're facing.    _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I just had an idea - I'm not sure whether it's a trade-off that you'd be willing to make, but it's something I heard here, and it might help a lot:  Suggest to your husband that one night a week (or day or whenever your work schedules allow it) you will have a 'date night.'  It doesn't matter where you go, really - the movies, out for coffee, parks are great if the weather allows that for you - bring a picnic meal and go with that, libraries, museums - something that doesn't tax your budget too badly, nor does it push much expectation on either of you except to be together.  Just for that period your and his focus is entirely on being together as a couple and away from The Spider and her toxicity.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Given the way that The Spider has been acting, it would probably best to arrange to meet away from where you're living for these.  Just have your DH tell her that for one night a week, everything else is off-limits.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ See if that would be something he'd be able to give you both from both your budgets of time and money, and if that would help you recover from the stress enough to get through til when you GTFO of The Spider's lair.

I haven't been to a gender therapist, I've only been struggling with gender issues for a short amount of time, and I realized just now that it may be my OCD that is leading me to obsess over the idea of being trans, perhaps rather than me being actually trans. So I just remembered this post and wanted to share it, because I think it's easy for people who have OCD to think *Oh, I thought about being trans, it must mean I'm trans* and then to keep that obsessive cycle going. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I truly don't mean to discredit anyone in the comments or intrude on this space. Like I said I'm still figuring it out, but I thought I should give kind of a dissenting opinion because OCD is a thing and people who are cis do in fact wonder or even obsess on if they're trans.

You mean crystal sand? The absolute fastest way is to farm red gatherer's scrips, 125 scrips will buy you 2 sand each and they're super fast to farm. _back_to_line_ If you don't have any gatherers high enough, you can spend 225 poetics per 2 sand (via mist/ink) or spam void ark for mhachi farthings (2 farthings per sand, also need 5 allagan catalysts but those are cheaper than dirt thanks to alliance roulette.) Trading GC seals for moonstones is also an option if you have enormous seal income but that's pretty inefficient.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Edit: If you have levequest allowances that you don't mind burning, [there's a leve you can spam](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/4oqjv0/possibly_the_easiest_way_to_farm_amber_vilekin/) for Amber-encased Vilekin, it's very RNG but you can usually get around 15-20 from a full stack of 100 leves.

It wasn't invented in the last five years.  Basic income had 16th century origins.  Raphael believed with basic income poor people would have no reason to steal or do immoral things.  Canada already tested UBI in the 70s. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ This idea that automation is going to take over all trucking jobs in a few years is also garbage. Currently for every one truck needed there is one third of a driver.  The demand is hot in trucking and basically if you buy a truck, you will make money. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Automated trucks will not replace jobs for quite some time.  They'll reduce demand, but won't kill the job market.  The average truck has a life of 25 years.  As trucks get phased out trucking companies (which are actually a lot smaller than people perceive) will replace their trucks with the most powerful, lowest cost vehicles.  The least expensive part in a trucking outfit is the driver. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Recruiting truckers is part of my job and we could pay as much as $50/hour and still the wage would be the cheapest part of the process. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Automation has been around for a couple of centuries now. Every luddite believes this time all jobs will cease to exist.

Factoring in growth, I think there will be more gasoline powered cars than there are today even with the rise of electric cars in the next 40 years.

not really much of a story i just happened to be looking for a Z at the time and saw this dudes ad pop up on autotrader one morning early as hell. Drove the hour to his place (it was a really small dealer, like the whole building is the size of a house small.) and spent the next 4 hours test driving and inspecting it before buying it on the spot. Honestly the dude already had it posted for cheap but he gave it to me even cheaper because it was such a quick sale for him. He had literally picked up the car from some larger dealer the night before; it was a trade in from what i understand. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 1 owner, registered in Florida with a full (like literally every oil change since 2007) service record 0 accidents. All stock too. I think honestly i just got really lucky that  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 1. I saw the ad so fast _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 2. I was able to buy it that day _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 3. He was nice enough to give it to me so low. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The whole time we were talking his phone was going off and he physically showed me like 3 different numbers that text him about that car in the time i was there, i`m confident that it would have sold that day regardless but i guess the stars aligned. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If i remember the dealers name ill let you know, he only deals in sports cars, on his small lot he had a bunch of miatas and one really clean yellow S2000. some other cool stuff but thats what i remember. all 5 star reviews too i cant say anything bad haha.

Um, no. Once again, you are repeating falsehoods. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Most rural places that actually use volunteers are struggling for volunteers and let people become *firefighters* who aren't even certified as firefighters. You can just show up, get your gear, take a couple of classes, and hop on a truck. Completely different from a career firefighter who has to beat out 1000 other people in a highly competitive hiring process, make it through an academy, actually become certified as a firefighter, go through EMT or medic school, and then survive a probationaty year if he wants to keep his job.
Its pretty crazy, we're living in a world were the stuff on the bleeding edge edge, like the MUTT, will probably be obsolete before it sees widespread use.

Joke was too subtle. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ You should have put the a in quotes.

Totally! And as humans, we tend to dwell on the bad trades more than the good trades. I bet you can remember every bad trade you've made, but you can't remember all the good trades you've made. 
As GRRM is so wont to do, the language and narration used after the encounter with Hotah/Swann/Darkstar/Arianne in the desert is very vague and lends itself to unreliable narration. There are theories that Myrcella was possibly killed in the encounter and an impostor is being masqueraded in order to not alert the Iron Throne, and possible insurgents of court intrigue, that Myrcella is dead. Hence, a facial maiming.

Which (unless we have a totally breaking physics breakthrough) is limited by speed-of-light, meaning that optical fiber connections is likely the fastest way to move data ***around*** the globe. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If speed-of-light is a true limit of our universe's physics, however, we could consider the use of high-energy particles (neutrinos?) to send data ***through*** the globe.

*Damien glances back at the girl, then to Terrance and ways up the options. He could stay and help Terrance, or get the girl to safety and come back to help Terrance...

Exploits come and go (get nerfed). I did planetary scans at quince (nerfed now), passenger missions at ngurii (not super high paying but also nerfed), ram ta's guardian scan mission, palin's thargoid mission, and allot of bounty hunting to remind myself why I bother. At the moment I think I net around 1.5 billion composed of around 10 small to medium ships (they are the most fun to fly), a combat engineered anaconda, and a trade type 9 (for when I cared about CGs). The amount of grind I put into this game has made me cynical, but I keep coming back because I get a new idea for a ship loadout. This game is basically like Lego where someone makes you work a part-time job to unlock the next brick or else you have to take apart your creations. 
Thanks so much! Great job on your progress too :)

&gt; We want a fully white society for ourselves. They want a society that's multicultural, where nobody is entirely sovereign. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I disagree. I don't think you've read much of Ta-Nahesi Coates. These coalitions fracture along racial lines the *moment* whites are out of the picture. All these minority groups are temporarily united against what they perceive as a bigger enemy. You saw this at Evergreen when the black students were saying that the Asian students were part of the problem, and there are plenty of other examples (gays vs. trans, Muslims vs. Jews, etc.). _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Multiculturalism is simply a cover for *not white*. It's painfully obvious whenever whites are temporarily out of the picture. And because victims are considered higher in the hierarchy, this will *always* end up fragmenting, because if you take the current *top* oppressor out of the picture (whites) the next group seen as most privileged will simply take its place, until they've divided down into the smallest possible group. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The alt-right is more up front about it, but I don't think the far-left's goals are actually all that different. They hide it from themselves better. But their goal is racial superiority, make no mistake. Affirmative action helping certain racial minorities, but not others, is a prime example. The anti-Asian and Jewish sentiments are other examples. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;The dispute is about what the fundamental makeup of a nation is. Is it commitment to equality or is it a people bound by blood to face their destiny? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If you listen to the far left, they are constantly talking about their biological groups. This is exactly the same as what you're talking about with blood. They celebrate how the percentage of whites in the country is decreasing. I *know* you've seen this. And their commitment to *equality* is a joke; their actions are to have power *over* others, not compete on equal footing. They want advantages, not equality. And they want this because they believe they deserve it *due to their biological standing*. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ To be fair, I don't think tribalism is entirely bad. Patriotism and loyalty can be very good things. But it *can* be bad, and I think the alt-right and far left's version fall into that category. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I don't expect you to agree, of course. But think back to all the times you've said on this very site how much you *agree* with some far-left author on a point, just from the opposite view. I think you'll find you agree with them a lot more than someone who thinks like I do would, for example. And I don't think that's a coincidence.
No you are :)
Yeah there were a couple I looked up and they went for a decent amount! We know a guy who owns a pawn shop in town and we got it there.
Was your grad program mainly research based?  I assume it was, as 50% on an exam being a pass seems a bit odd.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ My grad program offered a thesis and non thesis option.  The thesis option being more similar to what you describe, and the non thesis option being more like undergrad (more coursework, more test based but still around 50% research).  The non thesis option is more *hands on* and is meant to prepare you for the work force.  You cannot move on to a doctorate program via the non thesis option.  The thesis option is meant to prepare you for the doctorate program, and was essentially more of a pass/fail grading structure.

&gt; Acepto cualquier sugerencia practica que tengas para obligarlos a hacer cumplir la ley y a prestar el servicio como corresponde. No te acepto *andate a otro lado a alquilar*. Si administras una inmobiliaria debes tener claro que no es tan facil por lo que puse mas arriba. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ mira habla con la inmobiliaria y preguntales si ellos tienen cuenta bancaria, tienen que tener... y listo le decis que le depositas ah√≠. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ si te hacen lio deciles que tenes el derecho a depositarles de la forma que quieras (si es una inmo grande no te pueden decir que no) tenes problema -&gt; defensa del consumidor (en menos de 1 semana podes depositar sin problemas) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ generalmente y supongo que puede ser asi que muchas inmobiliarias no quieran que le deposites porque sino ellos tienen que poner de sus bolsillos plata (ESTADO PIJA RETIENE IMPUESTOS EN CUENTAS INMOBILIARIAS SIN SENTIDO POR GANANCIA CUANDO NI SIQUIERA ES PLATA DE LA INMOBILIARIA) para poder pagar el faltante a los due√±os, pero no te preocupes que si o si tienen cuenta y se hacen los boludos. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ edit: a y olvidate del que te pueden hechar, nadie puede rencindirte el contrato, solamente vos podes. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; Tengo todo en regla. Como te dije anteriormente, voy a una inmobiliaria por la propiedad, no por la inmobiliaria en si, mas alla de que si algo es muy turbio no alquilo. Y como te dije, esta es una de las inmos mas grandes que hay en la zona. _back_to_line_ Desde mi punto de vista me como todos los pijazos que hay y por eso puteo. Yo cumplo con mis obligaciones en tiempo y forma pero la inmobiliaria no presta el servicio que deberia prestar y me cobra como si lo hiciera. Si pasa algo, las soluciones se demoran muchisimo. El due√±o idem a la inmo. Ademas de todo esto tengo que entregar cualquier cantidad de papeles para alquilar, porque existen un monton de inquilinos lisa y llanamente pelotudos que destruyen los lugares que alquilan o directamente los usurpan. Son papeles que puedo conseguir y garant√≠as que puedo dar, pero no deja de romperme los huevos, porque a fin de cuentas yo demuestro que voy a cumplir con mis obligaciones, las cumplo, y despues las demas partes contractuales hacen su parte a medias. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ lo de las garantias es fundamental, lo siento podes ser alguien de hecho y derecho pero a nadie le importa, vos no vas a bancar a cualquiera que no conoces por mas que te diga que no te va a cagar y vas a tomar todas las medidas necesarias para que no suceda, porque si sucede despues te comes un garron de 1 a√±o pagandole a un due√±o un alquiler porque elejiste mal un inquilino y no te paga (inmobiliaria). _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 
Why is he doing that? Are they supposed to vote when their name is called? 
Thank you! He's nervous but I think also relieved that he finally did *something*.
&gt;I'm sorry but without having access to their code how could even remotely claim to know that? Software development doesn't work they way you think it does. Suffice to say making such major changes to the back end networking is not some drag and drop thing like you seem to think, I don't know what else to tell you. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Im not talking about PUBG, im talking about UE4. Most of the critical changes EPIC did, was related to actor replication. You can be 100% sure PUBG hasnt touch any of that, none of the multiplayer games right now using UE4 have touched it. They just dont. They work on top of it. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I find it funny how you say 'i dont know how this works', when clearly you dont. You can easily have a base system be changed, and have it integrated in with not much issue. Its how things are designed theses days, to be modular. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;Coke is not Pepsi's customer, they're a competitor and that's completely different. Coke hasn't paid Pepsi potentially millions of dollars for it's services as Bluehole has probably paid Epic by now.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Like ive said multiple times now. Bluehole has no 'relationship' with EPIC GAMES. They had no 'deal'. This is all lies, created out of thin year, by people like you, trying to justify stupid shit. They are at the same level as any other dev using UE4 in their game. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I actually have some inside knowledge about this funny enough. Bluehole was trying to get into a proper engine level deal with EPIC games, but epic was refusing. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ They not going to make 'more money' with Fortnite. They going to make as much money from PUBG as they would if they did nothing to help Bluehole. They get a % of the sales, because like i said, PUBG is in no special agreement with EPIC. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Its not a 'dick move'. EPIC is making amazing changes for the engine, that everyone is going to benefit from. And they only way they were going to do it, was by having a live product themselves. Any real developer will tell you that. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ They didnt 'knock that off', they literally used the term PUBG once, and people like you tried to turn it into a bigger thing than it really is. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The reality is. They are upset because they know they either have to shape up, or they are going to lose all their players. They have already lost their top streamers, and the last few are soon going to be done with PUBG as well.

Sure thing! You're going to okay. Acknowledging the past and being self aware about the issues you have now because of it is SUCH a powerful and important step you have already made!

Neither, like I was creating the sound but not like you create words by speaking but like my will was what controlled the music and I was the music. I felt as if I had no body or identity but the music. The illusion was voilently shattered when I tried to make a noise which translated to suddenly stomping my foot (I was not trying to make the noise with a stomp that's just how it translated). This obviously didn't change the song playing on the speakers and I was voilently made aware that I was a person and spend the next few minutes trying to figure who the fuck I was, where I was, and how I got there.
That a big possibility my man!

Wait wait, again you're playing fast and loose with facts. Maybe you're misinformed, maybe it's a lie but let's rewind: _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The Clinton campaign paid for opp research from Fusion GPS. Then *that company* hired a Brit who *was once* a spy (for our close allies, The British). He was not a foreign agent, he was not operating as a spy at the time. He was hired to perform research. He did so and what was uncovered connected Trump to our non-allies, The Russians. Meanwhile, Trump's campaign was *incidentally* surveilled while communicating with a Russian agent who was being surveilled as a matter of routine because we spy on foreign agents. When The Trump campaign talked to a foreign agent, it got put on tape. What part of this is troubling to you? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The justification for surveillance did not come solely from the dossier. The dossier was not the result of a foreign spy. Clinton nor her campaign never paid a spy. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ What should be troubling is how much of that dossier is being confirmed and how many lies have come from this administration about their foreign dealings.

Before I went to law school this was my job at a law firm. It is not especially hard but too time consuming for you to spend your time doing. My advice is to hire a me.

If you're just going to be making stuff up on the spot, there's really no point in continuing this. The idea that right wing is about *traditional hierarchy* is complete nonsense. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ As for left movements valuing equality, I think you need to read up on what some left wingers have done in the past... Here's some key words for you to search for: the Holocaust, Jim Crow, the Armenian Genocide, Holodomor, the Great Leap Forward. They sometimes pay equality lip service, but what they really want is all peasants to be equally powerless before them. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Anyways, I've spent enough time responding to an obvious troll, goodbye.

I guess this is pointless if you think free molecules cannot transfer momentum. To each other or to another object. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I wonder how propellers work. It seems gas is interacting with the propeller. Or wind, it tends to feel on your skin or even try to bump you over if the gust is strong enough. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Produce a controlled explosion with molecules bouncing off the object in front of it will lead to momentum transfer from the molecules to the object. A rocket in another words. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ After the gas exits the nozzle they indeed are free to do whatever, but while they are constrained they do interact with each other and the nozzle / chamber. The chemical reaction produces pressure in itself. If pressure was impossible in vacuum, we didn't have atmosphere here on Earth. Somehow we do though. We are surrounded by vacuum just like a rocket would. One could take this a few long steps ahead and say the Universe is a closed system, thus nothing in it cannot interact *with itself* and thus nothing would ever accelerate. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Again, if they didn't be able to interact, wouldn't they pass straight through said object / nozzle / chamber / rocket, without having an effect?

Transferring is different, as the requirements will generally be higher and specific to the schools involved. I did dual enrollment in my senior year of high school at a local community college and got 4 classes out of the way, 2 of which were english classes, and got A's and B's in all of them and my current university accepted the credits. I'm not sure if that follows the same rules as a transfer student though.

Agreed, reddit threads, especially on populated subreddits, who are even remotely concerned with anything *futurology* have 99.9% of people thinking whatever they imagine is just around the corner.

Exactly. While the majority of people picked Ngannou to win, pretty much all of them thought it would be by knockout or tko. As much as Hamilton had struggled since coming to the UFC, the only men to ever submit him were Oliynyk, who has over 40 submission wins, and Fabiano Scherner, a third degree BJJ black belt. If Hamilton was going to somehow beat Ngannou, it was going to be by smothering him and possibly submitting him. Instead, he got submitted by a kimura, and I never saw that coming.

One wonders if genius-Taravangian was so good that he deliberately predicted things that are wrong, knowing that the Diagram would do the *wrong* thing, and knowing that nonetheless the good guys would win. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I'd be a little surprised if Sanderson takes that route though. Between the flaws in the Diagram, the flaws in Odium's future-sight, and the flaws in Renarin's visions, he seemed to be pushing a free will, *the future is in flux/not completely predictable no matter how good you are* narrative. Plus, of course, Hoid's warning. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *Be wary of any who claim to see the future*. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ That's a lot to unpack, since there's so many people that could apply to--Kaladin and his painting, Taravangian, Odium, Renarin, and of course Hoid himself. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I do appreciate you drawing my attention to Cultivation's hand in events, since I spent much of Oathbringer wishing she would get her ass in gear and send some help.

Honestly this is what drives me fucking nuts with these big push bills.  I agree that we need a serious conversation about cutting corporate tax rates and eliminating deductions.  But there's nothing reliable or honest about packaging that in with a personal tax overhaul and a shit ton of political talking point issues like state income taxes, church political participating and the individual mandate.  It's shady as Hell and turns people away from the issues that are straight up good economics.

I just meant closing the night service over a period of months in places, no impact to daytime service.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The real benefit of a longer closure is people know what to expect and how to plan around it.  I have seen lots of late night station closures in Manhattan on the N that are only Tuesday to Friday, on alternating weeks that sometimes dont happen, and sometimes its only some parts of Manhattan and sometimes its just lower Manhattan, sometimes there's shuttle service, sometimes you have to take the 4,5,6 line instead.  It's super inconsistent.  I'd rather know that I cant take a particular line for a few months than hodge podge a way home from work at 2am every night.

Theres also a 7 second difference in cooldowns. herc gets 2 things from his heal, prots and a heal. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ herc only gets power from his passive when hes getting hit, you get it from drinking and if you kill someone, youre not always getting kills so this isnt really major.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ trans on hercules in an actual game is nonsense, just as nonsense as thoth is on bacchus.

It depends what you mean by reformation.

So it depends which people you're talking about. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ So which reformation did you mean? I meant the first while it seems you mean the second.
That's because they are paying millions to those investment bankers in NYC to invest their money for them. They aren't contributing to society. All they are doing is making the smart people (who also don't contribute to society) rich to make them more rich.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I have a family member that is the prototypical investment banker. Went to the best of the best ivy league and then MBA program and is now making millions to take these richer guys money and tell them how to invest it.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It's sad when then the nation's brightest people who are looking to make the most money are pushed towards something worthless like investment banking. It helps nobody except themselves and the guys money they are using.

Idk how she has no ability to farm, powershot+clarity all day. I don't think she is bad in lane (tbh I'm doing some aggro tricks that are non-standard in my bracket, so maybe I rate elusive offlaners like wr or weaver too much). _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Only time I lost offlane in the recent games was against rhasta+disruptor+void, and other offlane got fucked so hard we won anyways. With Chen. Against Tinker. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I feel her biggest problem is transition - she doesn't really like going full utility, so she still requires some snowball. I just feel it is achievable with Javelin build - if you didn't try it yet you definitely should. Maybe 4k carries are just bad and 6k carries won't eat powershots in the face and instead will kill ancient stacks made for them by their 6k support jakiro, who will tp to the safelane and stop your puny attempts of taking their tower. That applies to all snowbally offlaners, though. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Considering cheaper way to get through winrun - don't really buy it. Very rare carries rush MKB, and Javelins are just 25% anyways. I'd be scared of new sniper and void in this regard, new MKB is an attack speed item.

You tax use of natural resources, like land and to a lesser extent, the immovable property built on top of it. Unlike taxes on movable property and private transactions, such taxes do not require violating privacy rights to collect, and if structured properly, I would argue they do not violate individual rights. You ensure they are paid appropriately by conditioning permission to use those natural resources on payment of the tax.
I know that, but I think most people would vote for themselves because they want to win, not because they really think their concept is the best one.

I have a Baratza Virtuoso that I really like.  It's pretty light on features - no digital timer, no presets, no stops - but I'm pretty sure it uses the same burrs as the higher-end Virtuo line (not sure about the Sette). So the grind consistency is great. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I just don't store coffee in the hopper and pre-weigh doses instead of using the (shitty) built-in timer.

The illness arc wasn't exactly the most *exciting* of arcs in the show, but I loved it mainly because it generated great drama surrounding characters like Carol, Tyreese, Hershel, Glenn, Rick, and Carl for examples. That's not to mention the mystery behind who fed the walkers rats (Lizzie, apparently now), and with the fences deteriorating, along with the Governor fucking everything up, it really felt like the prison was at stake. There was a sense of claustrophobic danger that I never got again in the show.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The second half of Season 4 was literally flawless for me. The only back half that rivals it is Season 5 (the third best season in my opinion, the first being Season 1). Season 5's fantastic premiere is a great indicator of a good season. I feel you WILL enjoy it.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ And with S6 and S7, you may enjoy it. But from experience, the show started writing in *jump the shark* moments that detract from my enjoyment. It's nowhere near the level of writing it used to have, but again, I'm not here to discourage you, just saying.
You're welcome. It's funny. I found there was very little security in my *real job*.  Beyond receiving the previous pay check there are no real assurances for another until it shows up. I was completely blind sided by my termination. I was putting the finishing touches on a project which I helped bring in under budget, by like 50K, when I was brought into my managers office.  And just like that I was handed a modest severance, told that I was no longer wanted and like a criminal escorted from the building. I was financially unprepared, but more importantly  I was emotionally/mentally unprepared. At least with a business I could always see most devastating things coming. After year 1, I felt very secure in my business because I controlled the next actions. Sure lots of little things came out of nowhere that rocked the boat but I could see the ship sinking icebergs clearly. 
Like basically every business ? 
Darkin lore's always had them as five, since Aatrox's release, *three known to history and two unknown*. The three are presumably Aatrox, Rhaast, and Varus's darkin, and one of the unknowns is the female one revealed in the new story. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ My issue is that Varus's lore has always worked with the idea of the corruption being a Darkin. Literally all they had to do was replace any mention of *corruption* with *Darkin* in his lore and then add on to that...

I don't get why people need to treat obsesity with such kid gloves. Habitual eating of the high-sugar/simple carb foods that usually lead to obesity is absolutely an addiction, just like alcohol.

To be fair, and I speak as a large, white, middle-aged confident conservative-and-affluent-appearing (and hence likely police-supporting) man, if I were to learn the pub I was drinking in was commonly frequented by police, I would never drink there.  Nobody wants to be near a drunk cop for obvious reasons.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The only issue I have with them having their own bar is, they're probably driving home drunk from it.  We should make it an absolute rule that drunk cops get driven home and put to bed by their immediate SUPERIOR and their personal cars dropped off by patrol at some point while they're sleeping it off.  Might discourage foolishness.  But cops need to get loaded and blow off steam just like the rest of us, probably more, and doing so in their own pub is IMO a better idea than having them picking fights with guys down the club

Indisputable . I absolutely agree. I definitely though Penn won their first fight at 112. But Edgar took the successful moments he had in the first fight and game planned to repeat that success in the second fight. 
Everything in RWBY is at least two things. I think Blake and Yang are going to meet on opposite sides of a conflict and fight, because Blake will believe that Yang must be stopped from doing whatever it is that Yang wants to do, and Yang will be emotionally committed and feeling deeply betrayed by Blake already. Then I think Blake is going to leave... and then later come back. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Yang shows lots of hints of being based on Billy the Kid. At least in legend, Billy the Kid was hunted down and shot in the heart by one of his own former friends, Pat Garret, who was himself a former outlaw who had worked hard to go clean and eventually was actually hired as the new sheriff of Lincoln County. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ RWBY mixes its stories up in ways that let them subvert each other. Goldilocks is supposed to be a brash girl who either gets gobbled up by bears as a cautionary tale, or gets so traumatised by bear attack that she 'learns her lesson' and is always 'well behaved' from then on. Yang has certainly gone through that phase... but now it's time for other stories to take their turn, and Billy the Kid never let his setbacks keep him down and came back from loss after loss- and The Beast eventually overcame his destructive rage and learned self-control.

So how many years of education does that represent? Is it not possible to work during college in the us?

AM010 goes up to about 3m (closer to 2.8m/s). The low value 2m/s was just for the G602, which was a side effect of the wireless efficiency tweaks just like the 500hz cap.

How do we know what version of Eobard this is? What major timeline events could be changed by locking him up? I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a risk Barry is willing to take.

It‚Äôs monotonous but it‚Äôs what makes this a comic book show...return battles with your arch nemesis.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Edit: I also think Barry is looking at his current problems. He knows he has to figure out how to defeat Devoe and I don‚Äôt think he wants to add the reverse flash on top of that.

&gt; But I also believe that if we go about it in a more civil way it will have a bigger impact.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The sad truth is it really won't. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ A good example is customer service. Often, CS agents are told *not* to help customers until they get very angry, simply because it means you do the least amount of work required. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It gets more complicated when you realize it's a manipulative tactic. If you *do* help them once enraged, you feed them a false belief that you're reliable and trustworthy, even though previously you were anything but. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; Screaming *OMG RIPOFF* and *BAMCO EVIL* doesn't further anybody's agenda and kind of devalues the point that legitimately concerned people. It splits the community, when instead we should be standing on this issue together.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I don't understand how anyone could be *divided* on it period. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Then again, I don't understand how any human can be pro-corporate. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; And sure, memeing it up about sense of pride and accomplishment did get Disney upset enough about the license that EA had to take action, but realistically, the OPTC community isn't big enough to produce that kind of public outrage.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Boiling it down to *memeing it up* makes it sound petty. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Disney took action because, hey, guess what, **they were trying to get little kids hooked on gambling.** _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Disney shut down an MMO (Marvel Heroes) they had very close ties to and immediately got the company who made it (Gazillion) dissolved with all employees **fired without pay or one last chance to get things from the office** just because the CEO had (longstanding) sexual harassment allegations come to light. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Disney doesn't mess around with things potentially tarnishing their kiddie image.

I hate to be that guy, but I personally write *late* at the top of my late assignments along with the date so that my teachers know. A few times, my teachers thanked me for my honesty and didnt deduct any points because a lot of other students try to place their work onto a stack of papers or into a different class' stack to avoid the consequences. Im a good student so late work typically doesnt affect my grade too much, but it helps build trust with my teachers so I don't typically mind too much.
Well we did last year...
Ok cool, I'll look into that.
Yes, hearsay is when you only have a 2nd or 3rd hand, etc. account of a piece of information, and do not have the means available to you to find the original first hand source to confirm. Which makes it soft evidence that is generally not admissible in most courts, (including for example in the USA by the 6th amendment) because it's generally useless garbage, wrong as often as it's right. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Your point?

I don‚Äôt believe the argument that hybrid cards *can* exist as either color is a strong one. The clamor about it going against the ‚Äúdesign philosophy‚Äù of hybrid cards is also weak in my eyes.

Varus's family didn't have any names.

Liking them isn't the issue. You are free to dislike them as much as you want, but you can't say that they aren't more than Varus' faceless family from the original lore. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If Varus' whole motivation is going to be getting vengeance for his family then we should probably know anything about them. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_

As if my last wall of text wasn't enough.. I forgot to ask you something about what you wrote: _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;However, I must say that I did not do this because I was scared/afraid of them or of what may happen or whatnot, but because I lacked interest. Also, I didn't trust them. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 2 q's _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ * *Lack of interest* - are you friends mentally stimulating enough for you?  I find I get REALLY bored and *lack interest* around people I don't feel are my 'mental equivalent'.. not suggesting I am rocking some genius level IQ..  but INTJ's LOVE understanding the world around them - and get turned off by people who don't share that intellectual curiosity of the world.  So maybe you need different friends. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ * *I didn't trust them* - is there a valid reason for your distrust?  Have they done something in the past to justify this feeling?  Or is it an unfounded *feeling*?  This could be a much more complex issue - on one hand I would say *trust your gut*, INTJ are pretty good at judging peoples characters... BUT it could also be some type of a *paranoia* complex / manifestation and that should probably be addressed by a Dr. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Sry for the 2nd reply.

That‚Äôs insane. Again, this is an elected official subject to a fairly short term. There is absolutely no reason to resort to violence as long as the politicians are abiding by the constitutional procedures that the vast majority of Americans feel is correct. _back_to_line_ Tyrants hold power via force and require force to remove. Legally elected politicians doing things you don‚Äôt like aren‚Äôt even close to something that require force to stop.  _back_to_line_ Now, when removing tyrants, we should agree that any use of force should be exactly what is necessary and no more. Threatening to murder a person‚Äôs family doesn‚Äôt fall in line with what‚Äôs necessary to remove a tyrant. It‚Äôs illegal, coercive, and not a tactic anyone should ever use.
So close! 
Yes, it looked like it was a direct from China type of item. Those typically take WEEKS.
exactly id also add ,Team training and team chem should be the same thing with just needing both players of a team to activate with jerseys and stuff to suplement,Id add secret chems like the legion of boom or purple people eaters or something to again add to theme teams,I want more incentivised chem boosts like +2's on some and +1's on others for every teir not just as a whole . _back_to_line_

Honestly, it's not bad but I have such a feeling that I am wasting my time looking around me. But many doctors tell me there's no rush and to just take all the time you need, people who rushed to apply and take MCAT told me that was the biggest regret.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ My suggestion is if you finish in 4 years or earlier, take your damn time. The average age of acceptance for Med school is around 24 to 25 last time I checked. Honestly, no rush If you are graduating 21 to 22. Il be blunt with you how others have told me *Just do some bullshit to add to your resume while you study*. Honestly, at this point, I have learned everyone justs pads there resume with random stuff and connections they have. 
Ironic, I know. But as a Linux fan, I just get annoyed when people say *PC, Mac, Linux* rather than *Windows, Mac, Linux*.

Why are you always so militantly political on the Howard Stern Reddit? I notice all your posts are basically righ-wing rants. I have no problem with political debates or opinions but out of all the subs out there to choose from that are political why the Howard Stern sub? It‚Äôs not like the show is overtly political.
Petty crime shouldn't be a death sentence in the US. Buncha armed, anti-government militia members literally took over a government facility for a month long *armed standoff*, and were acquitted, and the *FBI officer* who shot one of them almost lost his job and went to jail.  Meanwhile local cops can kill choke you to death for selling loosies and shoot you for resisting arrest, or shot for just complying when asked to show your CC licensed if you're black, and the officers get the same treatment at best, or sometimes they just get extra paid leave. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Speaking from experience, as a white kid I was caught with marjuana/paraphernalia 3 times, only punished for it once, a night in jail and a fine,l to have charges reduced to littering, the other times the cop made me give it to him or break my pipe.  I always got to keep any pills I had on me as long as they were in a preset option bottle with my name on it. Meanwhile my black friends got their car seats and roofs slashed just for *smelling* like weed, and if they were caught with weed/pills on them they faced felonies. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ This is St. Louis by the way. Maybe it's not like this everywhere, but St. Louis has real fucking problems. Michael Brown was a criminal, but being a criminal shouldn't earn you a summary execution in the US, and for most folk it doesn't.

Unless you're willing to buy a used ball that only needs additional drilling, yes. If you find a ball that you like that needs a plugging then drilling, it may or may not be as expensive as buying a new ball then getting it drilled. It honestly depends on the brand, company and condition of the ball.

I'm hip to chat if you're up for it. With the ED decision right here it's lame to have no one to talk to.
No, an empiricist would say that since I needed experiential sensory information (i.e. I had to be told or shown that you returned home on Friday after a weeklong holiday) to make the deduction that you weren't home on Thursday, the knowledge of your not being home on Thursday is a posteriori knowledge that was ultimately derived from sensory experience.

I'd make sure it lined up with WBL (which I guess I'm a bit obsessive over): the formulas will probably break if it's unslotted. I'll give it a shot. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Light fortification = +1 enh. bonus. Technically, it's meant to be applied after a +1 enhancement bonus, so it'd provide +1 to AC as well. However this will push the GP cost way out of the park for that level, so we'll fudge things a bit and forget the enhancement bit. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Fine, now it's slotless, so double that for 2,000 gp, a third of the PC's WBL at level 4.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ There you go, 2,000gp. As this 'item' is custom, keep an eye on it, but as it's only a 25% chance of crit negation, it should be alright. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Edit: Note if we applied +1 then light fortification, it'd be priced at 8,000gp, way too much for the PC. Bonuses to AC are pretty difficult to get, anyhow, but that's the 'legit' way to get light fortification, at least it is until someone corrects me.

In the case of *love*, you don't need to read too much into it. It's just an informal and friendly way to address someone. There are regional variants too. My grandma was from Nottingham, she used to say *duck* instead of *love*.
I don't, and that's always where I end up. It *must* be a more advanced cartridge firing from a standard platform that has been retrofitted to suit their needs. Still, tho, it takes me out of that world for a second.. I think the image would have more impact with a bit more variation to the firearms. 
Allowing myself to have my feelings has been a big part of my emotional recovery. Drinking life is all about not having feelings, and now that I no longer drink, I also try not to question feelings that I am having. I need to feel them and be ok with them. In other words, if something happens and I feel really angry about it, that's fine and not a problem. If I pick up a drink over it, big problems! _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If I am having a feeling that I find really disturbing to me, then that  recording I listed at the end of those links is very helpful for getting through that feeling. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_

They wouldn't have the numbers to block it. House would vote to suspend standing orders to consider/advance/pass the bill.

I think insurance companies can be bastards no matter what state you're in.  If they don't want to pay, they won't pay, even if you're their customer.

Ah okay! Point conceded! And you know what I'm sorry for being a dick with my *einstein sagan blah blah* thing. I got strep throat yesterday and I'm in the worst mood ever. Not that it's an excuse. I am sorry. But if you don't mind, please give me what you think is the reason that chronic marijuana smokers who don't smoke cigarettes do not have a higher rate of lung cancer, or other cancers, than the general non-cigarette-smoking public? This is, to my mind, a knockdown argument against the view that marijuana causes cancer. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Yes, every burning plant has carcinogens. But it is fairly apparent to me that the anti-cancer agents in cannabis MORE than cancel this out. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Edit; here is a study.

I'm going to say $700 based off of eBay prices and the price I paid for it a few months ago. Negotiable of course!
I like the pacing in the anime too, scenes are fleshed out just a bit longer, the only thing that has bothered me when watching the anime  was that a lot of the comedic scenes felt really jarring which wasn't really the case for the manga, I think that's just mostly because of the medium shift but I think if they lessened the chibi features it would make it less jarring.

Oh we do, but our safety culture is obviously pretty strict so screwups tend to be poor results or failed experiment rather than something properly stupid (thankfully!).

I know man! I feel it some of RZA‚Äôs best lyrics and delivery ever. All the beats are on point and the whole atmosphere of the album is excellent. Man, I remember making a pause button remix of Defective Trippin when I was a teenager and all my friends loving it haha.
And the TDR watermark may simply show that this school is being watched from above, haha.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; Tho, that is an interesting observation that Kokichi caught on so quickly. I wonder if when he said that he can spot a liar holds true or how well he can figure out when people lie. Or would it be more like a way a spiritual medium talks where they ask very general questions just to gauge the reaction and find some info they could hook on to, you know to prove they aren't a scam. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Indeed, people have asked me to explain how I think Kokichi's talent works if he's actually a seer and has been disguising this talent all his life, and one of my guesses is that he can tell someone's lying because the statement is absolutely false but he can also see outcomes so he leaves certain lies alone while ripping into others and he covers up his supernatural ability by being such a liar he'd logically know when someone's lying. 
Dumbfounded silence at the sheer idiocy of such an event.

I feel pretty confident yours are Freeman's. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 1. Like you noted, same medallion. _back_to_line_ 2. Distinctive heelcap shape. _back_to_line_ 3. Two lines of stitching on the top of the wing, one line below the broguing. The only other vintage brand I found with that detail is Hanover, but the medallion, heelcap, and wing seam don't match. _back_to_line_ 4. Same broguing and stitching on the bottom of the facing (where it is right next to the wing).

Yes. you cant CC him with Riven for example or a Mega gnar strun if he does that fire breath thing. his base stats are so high and he doesnt even has to leave lane to buy something coz he can just do it everywhere on the map. his waveclear is also really good.. overall this champ is just bused af and melechamps have no chance against him no matter which champ it is.
Currently it's the best time to be U/X/X control in modern since 2013, with jeskai being the deck with one of the highest metagame shares and both blue moon and U/W control being in the mid to upper tier 2 ranges.   _back_to_line_    _back_to_line_ The problem with AV isn't that modern is too fast right now (Right now I¬¥d go as far as to say that this is the slowest modern has been since I started activly playing the format) or that control is bad, it's more that your early turns are very valuable, so suspending AV T1 is not allways as great as it should be and, much more importantly, it's a atrocious topdeck so overall there are just better cards to chose from.

You are correct. 
It depends on how bad your eyes are, which surgeon you use, and where you go (i.e. do they bundle everything together, or charge you separately for things like painkillers, eye drops and follow up appointments?) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I won't lie - the pain was tied for the worst I've felt in my life. It felt like they scooped out my eyes with rusty spoons with serrated edges, then poured salt in them. After the numbing drops wore off, I couldn't even open them. Once the Demerol kicked in things were pretty nice, but I was incredibly sensitive to light. I couldn't even look at the glowing apple on the back of my laptop. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ But after the first day, things got 95% better. It wasn't even pain, more of a discomfort. And after the third day, there was no pain or discomfort. My vision was still blurry and jumping around, but no pain. It took about two weeks to stabilize, and then the vision sharpening just came in really small increments. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I'm glad I got PRK done instead of LASIK. There's absolutely no sign of surgery on my eyes, there's no flap to ever come loose, and my corneas are thicker than if LASIK had been done. If I ever need to get a touch-up in the future, my eyes will be in better shape for it. Plus, PRK is more conservative and time-tested, two things I really wanted when it came to my eyes. Eyes are irreplaceable, so I wanted to act cautiously.
Nah, it's grace in other versions lol.

I have no idea about video editing, but you really should specify what you were asking about then. Your motherboard doesn't allow overclocking your CPU which means you can't improve that but you did buy an overclockable CPU. And your GPU is pretty low end. No idea if video editing is more CPU or GPU intensive, but I'd guess CPU, so the 1050 ti part isn't that important.
I can‚Äôt believe they‚Äôve done this.
And the free software community is trying but it is not easy you compete with companies with tons of money and some of them also release gratis proprietary software because they are using you for your data or to lock you into an ecosystem. _back_to_line_ I am Ok with people that use proprietary software if they understand what freedom they are giving up because they made an informed decision, the point is to educate the people to know that this freedoms exists and that they are giving them up and that in some cases are alternatives and in other cases alternatives are not yet ready but people are working on them. Is the same with Facebook, is ok to use it if you understand what you are losing, Facebook will not educate you so others will need to show/explain what you lose now and what the  future will bring.

Ditto, but it doesn‚Äôt really stick until you‚Äôre generating questions and answering them yourself.

I have nothing against kids watching TV, but her logic is, well, Jenna logic as usual. She seems to think that having kids over to play will be more work for her unless they can sit and watch TV or play video games for hours without bugging her. But the beauty of friends is that they will play together without those things. She doesn't even have to sit and craft *with* them. She just has to provide things for them to do/play with. When my kids have friends over, it's actually less work for me. I limit screen time during play dates after one of my daughter's friends wouldn't stop playing a game on her tablet. I didn't realize it until my daughter said she had to entertain herself because her friend wouldn't do anything else. She's just so lazy and alien.

I would argue our line person per person is more talented than the Eagles but yes as a team your D line is unreal and statistically better off. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The hawks defense has a lot of injuries that has been taxing them more (battered secondary, Avril injury, etc.) and our offense has basically kept them on the field far too long and they get burnt when they are on the field after every 3 and out.

YOU WERE A TRENDSETTER IN FANDOM!! That's so cool! What a neat thing to have happen to you! _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Regarding your OTP, I think most of us thought of our first OTP as the only OTP we'll ever have, but most of us ended up finding new OTPs, even ones who we love more than the original one. None of us would have believed it if somebody had told us that would happen, but it did. There are some exceptions: some people jump from OTP to OTP like changing underwear, and others have a very, very good fit with their first OTP (like you do) and that makes the first OTP a hard act to follow. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I do hope you'll eventually find another OTP who inspires you and makes you fall in love with them, even if you don't feel quite as strongly for them as you did for your original.

Define nemesis system. TPP already has AI that adapts to counter your playstyle (if you get many headshots they will focus on bringing helmets), although it is not super significant. In Shadows the nemeses do not adapt to your playstyle so much as just have unique traits.

Pinch to zoom still works for me during image playback with the 2.00 firmware.  No go during live view, however.  I wasn't aware that pinch to zoom on the touchscreen was an option during live-view shooting in earlier firmware versions, I've always relied on the punch-in activated by pressing a button on the camera (I have that function set to a custom button currently, but I think the default location is pressing in the rear command dial).

Wow I just came over to this sub because I heard there were Issues. I got fucked yesterday as well in that flash crash because I flipped my BTC position from long to short thinking BTC may just pump another few hundred/ or thousand before it blows off and came very close to liquidation twice (once because I entered a trade when I really shouldn't have). I've made and lost a hell of a lot more on bitfinex before (A LOT more). It's not their fault but this sub is eye opening. Calls for regulation(seriously WTF), no understanding of bids being pulled and someone dumping the order book in illiquid alt coins that have very few market makers. It's really not BFX's problem at all, traders take advantage of illiquid low market cap coins and liquidate people to their advantage. Crypto has always been like this especially the alts.

Same here. Although I do have some funny stories from when my limited grasp of Japanese failed me (like when I probably made the cashier at McDonald's think I was a serial killer or something). _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Edit: Alright, story time. I had just come back from seeing the Fushimi Inari shrine, it was late, and I was hungry. I walked into a McDonald's and started to look at the menu, but then realized in horror that I might not be able to specify what I wanted. So I was just standing by the door and thinking about what I could ask for, and all the while that poor cashier had to just stand there and smile at me. For context, I'm a 6'2* white guy, so I stood out like a sore thumb in Japan. Eventually I walked out the door and crossed the street to get to a convenience store. As I was walking down the aisles, I realized that I would have to take their food home and heat it up. So then I had go back to the McDonald's, continue thinking, and finally place my order. Thankfully, the cashier gave me a placard so I could just point to the side and drink I wanted. So in the end, I was able to get my food and return to my hotel, but I felt like a total creep.

What I meant with that is, it wouldnt work in the long run, its like when SFAT went Marth against M2K and it looked somewhat good and looked like it couldve worked, but M2K said at the interview it was because he just didnt know what to expect at all, since he'd never seen SFATs Marth.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If you play someones new character from scratch, naturally its gonna be more successful for that person. You wouldnt know how he plays neutral, how he combos, how he plays defense, what he does from the ledge, how he plays with platforms, all these factors. So what Im saying is, it wouldnt work in the long run, because its not polished. Ppl will figure it out, he doesnt have enough hours on Marth to make it work on his skill level in such a short time.

They burned down their own gazebo because they didn't want it anymore instead of just tearing it down. Set their house and a neighbor's roof on fire in the process. Planted a stash of Meth in one of the neighbors houses somehow then called the cops on the neighbors. Those people needed to go.

so in siege you can hit any base that you've successfully attacked any defense on, or that *any* of your bases are connected to, even if they're isolated. so yes, they could still attack the b1, b6, one of the b10s (your original one i think?) and what was their 11.
It's a 3.0 source, but the ideas can be easily adapted. So much good stuff.

The trade proposal would include our 2018 first and they likely will not have a first round pick next year, it is a highly situational trade though. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It depends on where they are closer to the deadline, right now they're posting league average Opp. Points per game and one of the  most inefficient defenses in the NBA, should that trend continue or get worse they could highly value Davis (with his bird rights) and Harkless as immediate defensive improvements.  Additionally allowing Davis to expire, gives them some flexibility to chase a star in FA.

$35 is the employee rate...not Friends and Family.  Many employees started making employee reservations for friends and then calling the hotel to *add the other person* who was supposedly arriving before the employee...but then, of course, the employee never arrives.  To stop this, many properties will now not allow anyone but the employee to check in to an employee reservation.  If another person shows up 14 hours earlier...tough luck...they wait for the employee to arrive and check in.  In most cases, once the employee realizes that they have a useless reservation, they attempt to cancel...only to discover that they are past the cancellation deadline.  So the end result is that the employee gets charged for an unused room and the friend has no room.  
SHIT

Eh, as an Engr grad myself, the things you learn are more for two things IMO. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 1.

To gain *some* experience with many aspects of the curriculum, so that if the need arises, you can remind yourself and tune those past skills as necessary for the job. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It's unrealistic to think that every graduate is going to remember every formula of every course. The point is more that the *ability* to solve is there, rather than the actual solution off the bat.

My original question wasn't why players prefer Reboot over normal servers. That reason is quite clear: faster and easier progression without spending money.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Now based off that reasoning, my original question (which was for Reboot MVP Diamond whales, not the average Reboot player) is what is the point of going to a world where you wanted faster and easier progression and spending exorbitant amounts of cash on it? Especially if that same amount could have gotten you just as far on a normal server. You joined Reboot because you felt this was your chance to not have to spend thousands of dollars to become strong! But in the end you spent near that much anyways on NX cosmetics you'll never see a return on.

Oh it wouldn't be a panacea for sure, but it would be better than using raw completion % to zero in QB accuracy.  Like I said in the other thread, my impression with Mayfield is that a lot of his throws are to an open WR or over the top to a guy who beat the D.  It's good that he makes those throws, but I'm more impressed by ones that aren't so easy. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If a guy is extending plays with his legs, great.  That's something worth knowing about.  But it isn't really tied to his *accuracy* throwing the ball.  Certainly an *accurate* throw to a wide open receiver has a much wider radius than one thrown to a guy with a defender draped on him.

Interesting idea.
How much does it feel like an abstract? Putting down sun divers in various positions to convert them sounds like it could be really dry.
that's what I hope.  They are trying not to show their hand just yet.  Until a leak happens.  Maybe it's bigger than we know.

You may be right... But you can still go suck a bag of dicks.
Huh, seems kinda weird. I guess the ordering makes sense though. 
Awesome, thanks !

I would love to see an ice climbers reimagining. It could be so much fun
You were **convicted** of a misdemeanor. You were **charged** with a felony. The fact that you plead no contest to the felony charge for a reduced sentence is how you got the misdemeanor.

Ok, why would you feel uncomfortable discussing that?
&gt; Why do they swipe right if they're shitty conversationalists? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Possibly because [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaoDfOaYF4w).

So is the jingle timing or standing in line?
Thanks for the response! Yes, I have most likely been abusing them I trip quite often. I‚Äôve only tripped alone once and I don‚Äôt really do psychedelics for a spiritual reason, and I don‚Äôt really work on the process of putting it into my life because I never feel like i learn anything.

&gt; In November 2017, nude selfie pictures of Barton surfaced online, which he acknowledged were authentic, and which he apologized for to his constituents.[14][15] He confirmed he himself took the photo, apparently from a video of him masturbating, and sent it to women with whom he was having consensual sexual relationships.[108][109] An anonymous Twitter user posted the photo of Barton, who had pointed his camera upward from below his genitals, next to a text message reading, ‚ÄúI want you soo bad. Right now. Deep and hard.‚Äù[110] _back_to_line_ &gt;  _back_to_line_ &gt; An anonymous woman said that she had received the selfie and other explicit images from Barton, but had not been the person who posted any of them on the internet. She also shared with the Washington Post a 2015 recorded phone call in which Barton warned her against using the explicit materials *in a way that would negatively affect my career*, threatening to report her to the Capitol Police if she did so.[111] On the taped phone call, Barton said *... I ... met you twice while married and had sex with you on two different occasions*; the woman said that they had slept together in 2012 in Washington, DC, and in 2014 in Texas, and that the Congressman had reimbursed her for her airfare in cash on both occasions.[112] The woman also shared with the Washington Post text and social media messages Barton exchanged with her, as well as a 53-second cellphone video in which Barton recorded himself masturbating.[113] She described to the newspaper encounters and contact with Barton spanning a five-year period, beginning in 2011.[112] She said she came forward because: *It‚Äôs not normal for a member of Congress who runs on a GOP platform of family values and conservatism to be scouring the Internet looking for a new sexual liaison.*[114] _back_to_line_ &gt;  _back_to_line_ &gt; A week later a second woman, Kelly Canon, a board member of the Arlington Republican Club and a member of the Republican Women of Arlington who is a constituent of Barton's, shared a series of messages ‚Äî some with sexual overtones ‚Äî that Barton had sent to her.[115] Barton sent the messages in 2012 and 2013, while Barton was married to his second wife.[115] The messages included questions from Barton about whether Canon was ‚Äúwearing a tank top only .. and no panties,‚Äù followed by *answer me miss evasive.*[115] Barton also messaged her that *men are men...and u r definitely a sexy woman.* When Canon responded that *all the good ones are married,* Barton replied: ‚ÄúI dont know about good..but I am married ... but ...I am not thinking good thoughts at this moment ... blush.*[115] Barton confirmed that he had the message exchange.[115] _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Barton#Sex_scandal
Yeah I never let my trainees get away with that BS. If it was even looking *close*, I would take over and rule it an unsat for the week.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ But that's me.

All we gotta do is keep telling doctors until every single one of them realizes that poppy seeds can replace any scheduled painkiller! _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I am kidding haha, I just hope in the future we can all be a lot more careful before telling medical professionals. All it will take is a single doctor researching into this subreddit to cause a severe issue.

I took on the role of temporary manager at my store. I get put on the same level of responsibility as a CES, complete with *oh hey I know you're only here from 90 days but sit on this weekly conference call, track these numbers and sales, blah blah so on so forth.* Plus I got saddled with 40 hour work weeks to cover other people taking their full weeks of PTO (never mind how I have 40 hours I'd *LOVE* to use up).  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ For all this, I got 75 cents more than my already underpaid for my area rate, and that of course goes away after the 90 days. I was getting paid 2-3 dollars an hour less than the going rate for a CES for doing the same amount of work. Company's fucking criminal.

I was under the impression that the blockchain needs to be scanned from the beginning for the transactions of a specific wallet and you wrote in the readme: * Thus, it does not use any **catching of transactions**, blocks, complex database structures and SQL queries. * so I assumed that the blockchain needs to be scanned from the beginning each time you login.
Perfect idea. I was going to take bin liners (the small white ones) but those sound sturdier.

You can't be banned for digital games because they don't have a header, and because the 3ds cfws aren't *true cfw* but rather patches applied on boot, they can't detect it. The only ways you can be banned are as you said playing before launch, or playing a physical 3ds game on a flashcard at the same time someone else is using the same private header.

Seed germination is a lot more tricky than that, you need to know how deep to plant the seed, what temperature the environment needs to be, etc. The small bits of info I've found say that growing this plant from seeds requires experience and knowledge, so I'm trying to find more info. 
Hmm, the way I've had it done was a layer of cream cheese on top of what's basically a slightly sweet, slightly cheesy thick bubble tea / milkshake. I'm sorry I can't describe it better, it's been too long.

I'm saying that if you can confront them, then you are obligated by the Social Compact to do so. Otherwise, let's just give up the pretense of giving a shit about one another and go back to Natural Law. Being afraid is perfectly normal and natural. Being a coward is allowing a criddler win.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ You think you're too scared to act now? Wait until there's no social order and those with strength simply take from you without consequence. It sounds hyperbolic, but my home state is packed with towns like this. No jobs, no tax base to pay for services like police and fire. Crime is simply left to run wild, fires left to burn. Murder solve rate in Detroit is 14%. Detroit Fire policy is just to let the city burn on devil's night. Flint has some great water and services you may have heard about. Saginaw is just apocalyptic. It's not a far stretch to imagine it happening here as people evacuate town and leave it to the animals. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ All evil needs to win is that good men stand by and do nothing.

Hey tunisia _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ There are cab companies all over NE DC Bladensburg road/Montana avenue area near like the 5th district police station, and a few are off Benning road in NE (around Benning rd and Oklahoma avenues) District cab, yellow cab, diamond cab etc...if you bring the paint to the shops they will paint the car...call them up and ask, they will do it for you. I am a fireman over in southeast and I talked to a bunch of the cab drivers in the area (at least 15 in a one month period) and every single one of them said either stop by or call up the companies. Bring the paint with the car and they‚Äôll do it no problem. The cabbies, every single one of them to a man, said they all bring their personal cars into work to get the cars touched up or repainted on the cheap. They will also cover the holes from antennas/wire ducts as well. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I had two contacts that I called and they said bring the car in, they would do it. I got the numbers from randomly asking cab drivers I would come across. Very nice, polite, and were willing to negotiate. I have since lost the piece of paper the numbers were on, but if you stop in the shop just ask, I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôll take care of you. Like I said every single cab driver that I talked to said it was no problem
Much of our current problem with a lack of rental housing started with federal government changes to tax policies - some going back decades - that made operating rental housing unattractive to investors.  Little has changed and I doubt investment money is going to flood back in.

While this is all true will Goku really have his guard down 1/10 times? He's had his guard down literally twice (both in Super). The sleeping scene in Z doesn't count because Goku is a living being and sleeps all the time, it'd be silly to count every time Goku sleeps.
Oh I hate to hear that seeing how I know that exact pain.. and what's worse is people are saying stuff like *oh it's a fact of life you'll get over it*... you don't just *get over* depression.. we don't choose to be depressed.. if it was that easy we'd choose to be happy

Yep I think so. 80‚Äôs or early 90‚Äôs  _back_to_line_ I think his car breaks down and possibly ends up flipped on it‚Äôs side. So he ends up sat behind it or under it relaying info to the robbers and the police.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Think the robbers are so stupid the chap ends up inadvertently giving them advice on what to say to the coppers because he‚Äôs so pissed off and just wants to go home.
No offense, but do you know what lynching is?

It's very much the contrast between the regular beauty and cadence of their music/lyrics and this stark, brutal, almost primal line that sticks out like a sore thumb. It's not a particularly poetic line, it's not sung beautifully, but it's sung perfectly for what it is. You see?

I believe we are enabling international shipping zones, yes. 
Anecdotal 'feeling', so consider my opinion worth close to nothing: Way more buyers than sellers, very few cashing out to fiat. This little dip is likely money sitting on exchanges waiting to be used or has shifted to altcoins.

Why not? What are you looking for?
I think these cheaper ones are usually using an lcd panel, and a UV led, instead of a finely pointed UV laser, like the form 2. It's definitely very similar, but there is a key difference which explains the price. Another variety also use projectors to provide the UV image.

I actually cleared my local storage in my attempts to fix the issue, but like the non-programmer I am at heart, I did a bunch of other stuff as well, so I can't say for certain what the problem was. It's possible (though unlikely) that it was full and simply stopped writing anything down.
Ava's looked at Odin with the specs before - she didn't see Pedri. Odin smokes to keep Pedri at bay, and he smoked on the ship recently, so she probably wouldn't see him. Actually I would argue that that's the reason we saw Odin smoking on the ship, so there was a legit reason for Ava to not discover Pedri yet.

Definitely, they are two different things, but they work hand-in-hand. We know quite well that adding value to someone's life as an entrepreneur goes beyond just trying to solve a problem. However, all we are saying that it is still a part of it. As entrepreneur, you have got to choose your priorities and/or reasons for operating a business. Sure, you would love to hear something like *your product changed the...* or *your kind of services were exactly what we needed to...* Have you not indirectly solved a problem, which is even evident to and acknowledged by your client(s)? You need to understan the point we are making.

Hey, great question! I've been spending time with 4 pairs of headphones lately. The Campfire Andromedas, the original Audioquest Nighthawks, the Audeze LCDi4s and the Focal Utopias.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The Utopia's are disgustingly good but I would never be able to have them if I didn't run a headphone company. They are unrealistically expensive for most.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The LCDi4s are really weird for in-ear headphones. I have a review coming out on them this week so there will be more detail in there, but they're pretty amazing. I don't know if they're $2500 amazing, but they're neat.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The NightHawks are really fun, and they just happen to be on my desk a lot.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The Andromeda's are my current favorite IEMs. They fit a little weird because of the non-ergonomic metal design, but they sound incredible and I'm just a big fan of Campfire in general. Really nice people that are doing cool things, and... they're in Portland! _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I should add that when I'm traveling I use ETY ER4XRs. Mostly because they jam so far into my ear that the foam tip blocks ALL plane noise. They also sound good.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ For music I've been listening to Beck's Morning Phase album (holy shit this is mixed well) and an album called Zaba (I think that's what it's called at least) by The Glass Animals which is a lot of fun on great headphones. Sam Smith's new album also sounds incredible with good gear. 
Thanks for the advice. Have you ever had, or heard of, an arc flash incident occuring when normally racking-in/out a breaker? I ask because we do a lot of 11.5kV breaker racking and many of the guys I work with only wear their 8 cal shirts with no face shield.

Got back to you. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ You said no one‚Äôs life has been ruined. That wasn‚Äôt true. Trump is allowing goods and capital to move freely across the border, but not people. Disgraceful.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ You failed to answer the people Trump is having killed and starved to death. Also, what about the war on whistleblowers?
It hasn‚Äôt changed. 
You commit to things to try and make them work if you want to. You can't be responsible for her happiness.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Say you buy her flowers, she might think 'How nice, he thought of me and wanted to show it.' and be happy. She might also think, 'UGH, you can't buy me off with presents.' and be mad. She might do both and then stop to think which motivation do I think is more likely/ want to believe? And then choose which reaction she wants to have. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ When we say I want to make someone happy, we should mean I want to help or give them the opportunity to be happy. Typically people shorten how we say things for convenience and so the distinctions can get muddled. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Either way trying to make her happy is just as manipulative  as trying to make her mad. **Its not her job to be happy for you, and its not your job to make her happy.** You will co-exist as closely as one of you wants, or one of you is willing. Whichever is less. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_

Except that I'm not a Republican in Alabama. I don't control who they vote for. I also didn't personally vote for Trump even though I knew he'd win my deep red home state easily. I didn't like the man and knew he was a terrible person. I'm still a registered Republican. I don't plan to change my registration. I'm fairly centrist politically. But the issue on Reddit is that a lot of people want to demonize Republicans. We're all a bunch of Trump-blowing, gun-toting idiots who are shitty Christians who hate gays and Muslims. That couldn't be further from who I am. But I am a fiscal conservative. If all you do is generalize every Republican like you are with this guy and criticize him for what other people in the party do, you only serve to drive them towards radicalization and being like the people you hate. Instead why don't you encourage him to continue voting for less ridiculous candidates?
Nice, thanks!

It wasn't the boycotters or the stock market that brought offline play to Battlefront 2015.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It was the people who played the game and were willing to give criticism. The same can be said for the cuts to hero pricing that started this whole mess: They'd have responded the same way regardless of whether or not the backlash was simply calling out the silliness or threatening purchase cancellation.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ All the same, the people who play are the ones who can actually provide feedback to glitches, progression, and credit gain fore actual insight on fixing the game. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Maybe that's why there's been a shift in attention from the devs to r/BattlefrontTWO, because they know that it's safe to talk to people there: https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7gejgs/developers_are_spending_more_time_interacting/ _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Also, why talk about Battlefront 3 at all, especially in regards to whatever impact you'd have on it, when corrections can and should still be made to Battlefront 2?
It got pushed back to Friday some of the previous providers of the scans were arrested

Sorry! It's just a tricky perspective.

Wow thanks for filling in the gaps , that was comprehensive! _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ So Highly Enriched Uranium is the goal, of course. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Do you think NK has HEU? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Depleted Uranium is another valuable resource and waste product they use in the ME wars too.
See that's just it, I would tolerate it because I would have to. That is not the same as accepting it and not having a problem with it. I'm not going to organize an anti-furry protest, but I'm not going to accept it as normal either.
This is very accurate. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If you start working at 18 and average 40k per year then you'll have grossed 560k by the time you're 32. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If you leave college at 22 and you're 80k in the hole then you need to average 64k per year to break even with the above at 32. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ And I'm not talking about trades, I'm talking about the kid who gets promoted to bar manager after a few years of washing dishes and waiting tables.  I'm also not talking about investing, which makes money you have at 20 worth twice as much as money you have at 30.  I'm not talking about all the people who decide they need a master's degree to get the job they want.  Or about all the college-grad jobs being in high-COL cities, or the ever-growing interest on that 80k, or the cold fact that you're not even guaranteed to graduate after taking on all that debt and spending all that time in school. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Just y = mx + b, find the intercept, *wow, if everything goes according to plan, my degree won't start making me money until a decade after I graduate.  Thanks, college!*
I will not have you treat my religion like a fucking joke you heretic
Well according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics here https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=550. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 22.6 percent were white.  20.7 percent were black. 40.1 percent were hispanic. 13.2 percent were asian.

&gt;It's hard to steal something that is BSD licensed. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;They are freely giving credit on their website as well: https://opnsense.org/about/legal-notices/ _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *giving credit* is not the same as respecting copyrights. OPNsense has been stripping out almost all pfSense copyrights from the code, uploading it as their own. Example: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CVCceq2VAAAHZ4T.png:large _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;One question - if OPN is behind the opnsense.com *parody* site, then why is it registered through a U.S. Registrar and the name behind it is assoficated with pfSense/Netgate? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I didn't say that. However OPNsense conveniently includes pfSense in the title, to portray the whole project badly. Just as they attempt to portray WIPO as an actual court. Same is with OP, single purpose account with intention to cause damage. No slander or *nazi* imagery were used. Hilarious really. _back_to_line_

Agreed. We're not sure if we'll try to take legal action for the money, but we're not sure if its worth the time and energy.. And lawyers are expensive...
Well that's only if they deleted this post - that's where the intent comes from. But honestly it'd be an interesting case to see play out, I think it could easily go both ways.
Nobody has, just give it a day or two.
Don't know why but most of the time users downvote. I only use legit sites as source. 
haha easier said than done
Add a little urine, blood, and semen to get my underwear right now.

This is reddit, where we make entire careers out of spinning the blatant as deep wisdom.
Agreed. Handled current events in the only way it could get away with.  I thought it was brilliant but needs a part 2.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Lady Mackey was hilarious. 
When the government refuses to change or even listen to their population's voice on the matter, people tend to think why they won't listen. The claim of issuing tickets for financial gain is a very reasonable and practical one since it is well documented that speeding tickets are an enormous revenue tool.

I love the movie, but Inigo and Fezzik are the main characters as far as I'm concerned.
Yeah. Inno literally did, too. Zero attempts at harass.
ah, like a stencil braille. that should still suffice.
Adorable!
You need the secret APM techniques for that
Right, that makes sense. Thanks Buzz.

It was my middle school, but now I go to the county high and the security team there is pretty good with proper protections on the network and the bios of all computer lab computers are password protected. Only downside is they give us chromebooks and the desktops are early windows 7 era optiplexes, so it feels like a downgrade. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ edit: forgot to answer your main question, yes we do get to take them home and as of late, they are the most recent air models, but I highly doubt the os has been updated since last year. As far as I know, apple's distinguished program is what provides the school the hardware.
Turn it off.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 7.1 surround on gaming headsets are a gimmick and aren't true 7.1 sound anyway. They just make the actual sound quality worse and muffles them.

Eh, still wishing death on anyone is petty. Yes, it will tank the market for sure, because healthy people will leave. Everyone‚Äôs premiums will skyrocket as a result, as well, even if you have employer sponsored healthcare. But we still have to fund the subsidies which I think is a percentage, not a flat dollar amount. If that‚Äôs true then the ACA will cost us more money.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Then the deficit will blow up and they will say the only way to save the budget is to kill the ACA and do entitlement reform. It‚Äôs a despicable plan but it will take a year or two to get to that point. 
I didn't tell him to go kill himself. His post was steeped in suicidal ideation, specifically claiming that OkC makes him want to kill himself because women don't want anything to do with him [and his red pill fascist beliefs.] I, specifically, compared him to an emo crying in a corner. That's a harsh truth. Another harsh truth: if he wants women to like him, perhaps don't call them sluts who need to learn their places as property of men. Seriously. Zero sympathy here.
It allows you to build teams using cards which you select (Has Jpn and Gbl) and it shows you links between cards, and you can select which cards to be leader and friend and what the stats would be for Hp, Attack and Def. But it doesn't account for leader skill. One of it's major uses is selecting a card and then showing all the cards which share a certain amount of links in the filter section (So you select SSJ4 Goku, show all cards with at least 5 shared links).
It's not though. You don't think one of the guys that got dosed and interrogated by a prostitute tried explaining his experiences to someone? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ You think every single person that happened to didn't confide in someone that something inexplicable happened to them? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I find that totally inconceivable.
^! Plus: After having ahd some first contact via corps public chats, BEFORE you apply: Check their killboards, throroughly read their description, check which alliance they belong to, check their descreption and killboard( do they kill? do they feed? WHERE do they kill or feed?), look at where they live, check ADMs/kills/whatnot bout their area on dotlan. Try a search for that corp and alliance on reddit to see if there is some memeing about them or backgroundstories to be found.
Just... I don't even want to find out whether any of that is true.
It just goes to show the current state of this subreddit. Sad stuff. Please know it came from a genuine place. Our society is losing touch with the underlying stuff that really matters. 
Just saying, I‚Äôve heard plenty of men say they are happy to be circumcised. You would never hear a woman say she was happy her clit was cut off. 
This is true.

My arguement to that...have you never seen anyone throw a forward kick and literally slide their planted foot forward while they do so for more reach? I have. Im sure a lot of people have. Its not uncommon.

Yes but the companies paying dividends already have the ability to do this and they are still giving out their money.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Might they want to pay less if they know Uncle Sam is getting a cut, but it's unlikely they would just stop paying dividends at all. There are other reasons companies pay dividends in the first place. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 
The schedule is by formula. The only thing we don‚Äôt know are the two ‚Äúextra‚Äù games against the teams in your team‚Äôs conference that had the same place in their division.
Cool.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 1) I friendly invade most lone-hosts who don't panic R1 spam me. I figure it'd be crueler to let them get away with this and just B/C out, so I'll parry and riposte them. A lesson better learned sooner than later.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Likewise, I'll often just relieve a host of their summons and leave, unless they do something really annoying like try to defend their friends.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 2) I pretty much do the same thing every time. I approach, wave, drop a prism stone and/or some ember (depending on just how desperate they look, but never more than 5 so as to not make their playthrough much easier than it should be).  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Then, I'll equip the untrue dark ring - I just find the red hue hard to trust - and maybe follow them around for a while. I'll kill any blue who comes in, usually with some white ring trickery if they don't spawn too close.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 3) Yes (and YES!). If I've had a rough couple of prior invasions (e.g. Two password summons and an endless stream of Blues who manage to get me and then point down) I'm ashamed to admit that I'll sometimes vent my frustration on a lone host.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Notable examples include:  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ ‚Ä¢ Following and protecting a host from Aldrich Faithfuls all they way to Anor Londo where I then killed them at the bonfire while they couldn't light it.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ ‚Ä¢ Gaining someone's trust and then initiating an L1 dance, which I then guardbroke and hornet riposted with a fire dagger.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ ‚Ä¢ Pointing downwards and then jumping from a fatal height with cat ring, only to have them follow and splatter themselves. To which I *collapse* like I'd no idea.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ These are pretty rare though, and I'd never do it to someone who looked like they were absolutely struggling.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Enjoyed answering. Thanks for asking, skeleton! 
It's kinda true. Lakkaki is a card that sits in my hand for way too long. Ecspecially against control, because I do not want to risk loosing key cards. On the other hand Lakkaki can give you huge swings. Lakkaki and Melch Imp are not too bad on their own and just the fact that they are demons is pretty good. Krul Lock generally lacks demons in standard(also for Gul'Dan DK) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Lich King is a card I also considered. Might try him out a bit, thanks!
I have to admit i was a bit late, his shield broke instantly. Luckily Mercy revived him, we kept the point and won!

Chalice dungeons are pretty whacky but the style of these models really seem like a departure from Bloodborne's style. If you had told me these were from a canceled King's Field or something I'd believe you. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ In any case they probably look way better animated and rendered in the game engine, but just look at that muppet monk.
Just tested with my roommate. He said it was very muffled but intelligible. Am not sure if it holds 100% because it was while I was in doors but not looking up
Nah, you're missing my point. No one is complaining that the game isn't easy enough or that it's too hard because of cooldown times on supers and abilities; you're making up your own narrative there. It's like you're bungie and completely ignoring what's being said on these forums.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ D2 doesn't feel as fun as D1 because everything feels fucking neutered now. If I wanted to just shoot boring guns and throw the occasional grenade I could play almost any other FPS. It doesn't feel as fun as it's predecessor is my point.
I agree having personal freedom comes with responsibility for your own life and some people would rather just be told what to do. 
Yeah, they def were. Her self-titled was definitely a sleeper hit.

University taught me that it's way cheaper to ignore you than understand you. 
It wasn't a thing because nobody realised it could be a thing. Some things haven't always been and always will be. Some things happen over time. Sometimes, rules are put in place to stop things from happening prior to them ever happening.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I think we can just agree to disagree at this point.

Sorry, it's me who went to sleep this time... maybe it would be better to arrange a time by comparing our availabilities, if possible. My time zone is [GMT+1](https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/?pl=1&amp;lid=12&amp;h=12), and I'm generally available from 9 am to 1 pm, from 3 to ~4:30 pm and from 9:30 pm to midnight (can stretch until 1 am. I can also try to find some time between 6 and 8 pm) from Monday to Saturday. On Sunday, I'm available from 10 am to 1 pm, from 3 to 8 pm, and from 9:30 pm to midnight/1 am.
Yeah I checked earlier and maxed out the settings. I'm just wondering what u/touchofred meant
&gt; Not sure if I should feel bad or proud. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Both. That's definitely how I feel.
That's really not very relatable. I see why you didn't want to share them now. Is that tweet/minute? How is density being defined? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Another way to do it is may be to change your figure to plot the actual number of tweets occurring at each 15 minute (since one minute is a short time frame). Then you can define the color range to be a linear gradient over the min (zero tweets) and the max (whatever the max number of tweets per 15 minute is). _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ This is interesting data, but it needs to be more readable and understandable. I can easily see where his density his higher, but I don't know what density is, how it's defined, I know the range now but the values are so low as to be meaningless except to the person who did the work. 
48 hours. That's my bet. And the only reason it's that long is because Doom 2016 was not an easy to mod game and that's it. Otherwise I'd say 24 hours. 
Nah that is mostly fair. But its rhe exlusionary of other fscts that drive me nuts. Why does he western powers, my counrru included fixated on selling weapons to despots in the middle east?

If they can squeeze healthcare changes in this year, I feel like they could squeeze internet regulation in next year.  It would probably even be budget-neutral, if whatever changes they make are first introduced and implemented as FCC rules (like the repeal of NN).

Okay, transports, got it. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ What makes my design a new class?

The first upgraded design worked fine but the second didn't.
I hate to seem like I'm jumping a bandwagon. What you said makes sense...even the conspiracy part?..I just know this is the right place to talk about this particular subject. I hope other share my perspective - there is good and bad and we should act on what we can control. I don't imagine it's unique, but as a whole, U.S. gaming revenue is forecast to reach $23.5 billion this year. We are important. We should find more reason to unite and act, especially with the progress we've made!
That is such a cool hobby! How did you fall into restoration of old machines ?

...I'll take the TL;DR and bleach my eyes.
&gt;Food and alcohol is $1,600. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If you're spending $1,600 on food and alcohol per month, you may want to check your spending habits. I got yelled at by my parents (who make 6 figures) for spending $400 per month, and they spend ~$300, albeit in a small town. According to [this site](http://www.bestplaces.net/cost-of-living/), Santa Barbara is less than 2% higher food cost than where they live.
The punchline is smirk-worthy, but overall the joke reads more like satire of the implied Christian joke teller than any kind of dig on atheists.
I noticed that it's possible to have something close to smooth locomotion by typing this command in the console(you can access it by pressing * ` * ): *bind STEAMVR_SECONDARY_GRIP _moveforward* _back_to_line_ By typing this command, you can move forward using the left grip button(It's also possible to use other keys), however you cannot use the shield burst in game anymore. _back_to_line_ 
Repressed is right. A lot of people call his prior attitude and actions 'learning' but in actuality he was just being stubborn in a different way. He never showed any finesse in befriending people, just getting beat up until Sera lightened to him and offered her protection.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Without Sera all he had gained was the ability to repress his attitude, which eventually shattered and will take a while to rebuild.

Do you actually know this?
That doesn't mean they are immune to cyber attack.  A floppy disk is just a memory storage device.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The article you linked also said they plan to be fully updated by 2020, so your proposal that they are safe from hacking because they are old is vanishing fast.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Their system was and may still be open to cyber attacks. Look up 2010 minutemen missiles, an employee error caused them to not be able to communicate with multiple nuclear missiles. Obama didn't like this and ordered a team to search out vulnerabilities. And contrary to your belief, they found multiple.

I will be doing so tomorrow! My plan was to hit up r/MonsterHunter, r/Gaming and r/Nintendo today and then r/Overwatch, r/AnimalCrossing and r/Zelda tomorrow. (I may have been super eager and looked up when the subs have the most people online, and it's given me times to post so that it can (hopefully) get the most coverage) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I've got my fingers crossed that a few people from OW will be answering the survey since the sub is so large, but it could be like Gaming and just be drowned out by the rest of the posts.

Awesome thanks! _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ But overall the engine is pretty much what we have with 2.X right? Not that it's a problem or anything just curious. 
Oh yes! The babies always seem to know exactly when the vows are being said don't they? At one I attended last year, the couple included their dog in the wedding and the dog proceeded to bark at guests during the. whole. ceremony. 
Yeah, I ruin those dates soon after the incident. It's happened a couple times when I was younger and I will flat out scold a motherfucker.

&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3 I might paraphrase this to others if you don't mind. Most people have NO idea what it is like to be in those shoes. I know the guys are taking a risk but what is the worst that can happen generally (in most U.S. states anyways)? They get their wallet stolen? A photo taken? Providers risk being raped, beat, abused, having unwanted photo's/video taken....etc. I don't even want to mention the ultimate risk. It's the least they can do to prove they are the person they say they are, when she is providing to them the most intimate of services and really risking her health and life to do so. I love what I do, but to pretend like the risk isn't there is ignorant. I wish all of the people out there that we spend time with, would keep this in mind the entire time. I am glad places like this exist so that there can be an open conversation about it. 
They knew about the razorback armada since it was full. They just waited for the plague star event to finish so as not to overlap 2 events. Steve even mentioned on twitter that it was going to be delayed.

Do you mean you don't have internet? If you are normally online when playing, I'm pretty sure all xbox one games automatically go to cloud, you don't need to have gold. Usually the games on your console are not the most recent ones (as I found out when I had crappy internet).
I went to high school with a guy who had a 0.9 gpa
Damn, I grew up in Frisco and it's crazy how quickly it's grown. When I lived there, Main Street was the only street with anything happening on it and when we got a Double Dip it was the most exciting thing. I left just as the big subdivisions came in. Hell, the high school was still the Fighting Coons until we realized that was probably a little too racist. 
This isn‚Äôt low effort. It doesn‚Äôt fall under those guidelines. No point in arguing because you‚Äôre just not right
Im not sure I follow
[](/lunamad) Yes!
Haha, maybe! I speak Japanese with them/everyone else at the school outside of class though, it's not like me speaking Japanese is anything new to these kids. Anyway, it's fun!

If you have chloroform, I have the time.
I'm a dick, I don't know how I missed it

Ok. That's a head start on CAPM and requires less hours. Read about project management or watch some YouTube videos.
I feel like this should be expanded into a haiku
what risk?
No I speak English and a little bit of a few other languages.
OK cool I used Smoke on last year's game, but this year I had only installed an option file. Will I lose my ML save?  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Also - are there any gameplay patches that you have tried and recommend?

So the cactus soil mix from miraclegro does have wood, perlite, and what seems like dried roots; should I add more perlite?
Eeh not really the default. Believing in a higher power with magical abilities is pretty on par for little kids. That's why Santa, the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy are all childhood staples. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The problem, I feel, isn't in the teaching of religion, its in the lack of freedom to explore other religions and mythos at the same time. I grew up in a very Christian home, but was allowed and encouraged to learn about the classical pantheons, Wicca, various Christian sects, pretty much any religion I wanted to. And I spent most of my high school years doing exactly that with an eye to what I actually believed, rather than just reading fun stories like when I was a kid. Most of the kids with religious homes I knew growing up never had that freedom, and I ended up being a resource for them when they had questions about whatever religion I was looking at - so long as their parents never found out. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Ironically, I'm still Christian, and most of them aren't. I think one old friend took up Buddhism, but most are either heavily agnostic or outright atheist.
Aatrox war _back_to_line_ Varus famine ( blight is literally his w, his e reduces healing) _back_to_line_ Kayn death (obvs, even turns into a ghostly reaper) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ And four horseman + anti christ or apocalypse embodied. It's clearly not exact as they aren't horsemen and they can do whatever they want. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I'm just saying that the three present darkin very closely line up with that theme

Congrats on the silver plaque. That would piss me off so bad, hope I get there soon...back down to 30 2*'s. I know it's easy to counter, but that's what's gotta ne this far. I need to switch it up...I did after 15 and then again @ 20&amp;25...this is what's gotta me to 32 but better players now, so I get it. Still though, I time him perfect (right after they play 2or 3 cards) and my clock hasn't gotten to 2 yat, but there he/she is for them. My Marvin's a 3 so he pretty much gets an X everytime, no matter who's shooting, unless the NK is 10&amp;up plus two shooters. Even if it's close I'll get the extra points with some other warcry. I've just become attached with this strategy, it's gotten me through some tough matches but I guess I gotta switch it up again to get that silver. If you're a good player, you can play, and play against, many different styles. Hate this energy thief's though...so damn frustrating. Good luck out there!

I agree she was uninspiring.  Apparently being a pop star is a better path to leadership in the U.S. than diligent study, knowledge, and experience.

I am not a forensic biologist but have a basic understanding of how DNA evidence works. DNA evidence compare specific part of your DNA (called a loci). A loci will have a particular sequence of nucleotides (A,T,G,C). This pattern of loci will be unique to a set group of individuals and cannot be changed (unless foreign DNA is introduced or in very extreme circumstances). One loci on its own may have a 1 in a few hundred thousand matches but the use of multiple loci decrease the probability of a match to the billions (not too sure on this but is much higher than a few million for sure) Currently 13 loci (IIRC) are compared when comparing DNA samples to known databases. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ DNA compares sequences of nucleotides. Sequences of loci possess a known patterns. It is objectively compared. Error is only introduced from human intervention.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Like I said previously, there are many factors that can change the fingerprint that has been deposited. These changes would result in different thickness of fingerprint ridges and valleys. They are not exactly the same. This would make the evidence subjective. Moreover, the probability of a match has not been tested but studies are being done to improve fingerprint admissibility.

He's going to be cheaper than most of the other guys in the same tier of offensive production (because his defense is ass) and Sandy doesn't put a ton of stock into defensive value. That's Sandyball. If it frees up a few extra million to throw at the bullpen then he's probably open to the idea. In a money-is-no-object world he'd be targeting a center fielder at the top of the market like Cain, but I can't see him having that kind of money to put into an outfielder while there's still glaring concerns in the bullpen and adding another infielder (likely a second baseman). I don't like the budgets that the Wilpons are giving to Sandy, but he can only work with the money he's given.
I grew up in Temecula back then. I‚Äôm telling you, they had fans and were annoying as fuck
Right before 13 came out, I played 1-12 (sans 11) just so I would know the stories and everything, I think 4 is my overall favorite. I also really enjoyed 2,6, and 12.

I'm going with Cousins. Average ECR has Cam #6 and Cousins #5. Sean Koerner (the best of the bunch) had Cam #3 and Cousins 5. However, he just made a change and moved Cousins to #4.

I would put what he did (if what he is alleged of doing is true) at maybe slightly worse than what Louie CK did (since at least Louie asked before he did what he did). obviously no where close to a Roy Moore, Kevin Spacey, Bill Cosby, Danny Masterson, etc etc...

Thanks. I wish and I‚Äôve thought about it but I don‚Äôt think Im apt enough to pursue a career in it.  I took a few finance classes in Uni but really there‚Äôs still so much I don‚Äôt fully understand even after doing it as a side hobby for 3-4 years now.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I‚Äôve also heard something like 90% of people that day trade as careers are unsuccessful - it‚Äôs an inherently risky business. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I think it‚Äôs best to do this while you work so you have reliable income to get by on. There‚Äôs only been a few days where I really wished I was at home to make trades but I was stuck in a meeting or something and missed an opportunity.  In the long run - the security of having a job while doing this on the side is the way to go.  I just try to work towards an early retirement but if my trading goes terribly I won‚Äôt be in a bad spot. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Good luck to you!
Yeah, that was what I guessed as well. I have had some of their nail stuff take MONTHS. lol 
&gt; I‚Äôd be happy if you were able to give a balanced assessment with details on what you also like about the neighborhood.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The thing is, I don't need to say positive things, there's already plenty of grandiose posts about the greatness of Shaw on here anyways.  Yes, there's the Botanical Gardens, Five Aces BBQ, and Ices Plain and Fancy and you don't have to fight Grand and Kingshighway getting further into south city.  However, that still doesn't entirely negate all things bad either.  It can be difficult getting back to the central corridor, there's not a ton of amenities, and yes, crime does happen there and occasionally violent crime does happen.
you can get away with a lot of frames but you lose quality the more you go (the interlaced image under the lense has less and less strips of each unique image the more you add).

I agree that its odd. I think any doubts or concerns you have about what really happened is valid. Reaching out to this person may or may not help. It could be possible that she tries to deny it ever happened, tell you you're making it up, or she might bring something up that would jog your memory. The real question is, if you do remember, are you okay with that?

It's OK to fuck off your own home with a loose wire, but they don't want amateur hour guys blowing up the whole damned neighborhood. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ OP's story doesn't quite add up, though, as union guys will always take some easy resi side work and there are zero elechickens in MA who wish they were plumbers, 'specially not the union guys. His attitude about getting *screwed by middlemen* aka trained and licensed skilled trade professionals with years of experience, is pretty much shit as well. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Best bet is to get the larger tank installed now, claim ignorance on who installed the existing stuff, and pay whatever they want to certify the whole kit &amp; kaboodle.

I don't really have much interest in anything any more. Used to enjoy reading - eyes fucked that up.

Harmonites are basically Necrophage kryptonite. Do you have to kill them? If not, because they are so slow, you can just move away. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ In general though, don't let them attack (stun and beam are both huge issues), you should be able to avoid that for the most part because of their speed. Also, if you have flying units, you can attack them from the top of a cliff and they can't hit back. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ In general though, don't fight harmonites with necro units without a definite plan, it's a recipe for disaster.

Yeah man, public universities operate like private universities in disguise. Anything to get you paying longer. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I actually researched this topic a lot when I was in school.

I called in school records to get a list of admin salaries, and everything was blacked out. When I requested a copy of the information, the record keeper ghosted me.

Thats interesting. I consider Litecoin the future of what crypto should be. Bitcoin won't be used as currency the way it is. High fees, high price. People hold it, they don't spend it. That alone gives me confidence that litecoin, with its superior tech, will be the go to actual currency.

You'd have to repeat a lie sufficient number of times in order to convince people of its reality. Even 'maybe' and 'what if' may be breeding grounds for an illusion to take hold.

Sprint is a popular feature because people like it. The tactical choice to drop your offensive firepower for speed  people overwhelmingly enjoy that simple, tactical choice.
Do you have any experience with the U. japonica? _back_to_line_ And I don't mean the zelkova. It's supposed to be a more hardy version of the U. parvifolia. Just from Japan. _back_to_line_ I'd like to get me an elm. So do I go with the seju, or, parvifolia, or the taiwan version of it..? I'm on the fence for two years now.^^ _back_to_line_ I'd like to be able to overwinter it outside, but it's not a necessity. Maybe the opposite, the thaiwanese variety that can almost grow on a cool windowsill in winter is even better, because it makes overwintering so easy. What variety do you think is best in general and for what purpose? Too many elms, can't decide. :D

I can't say much about your chances at art school because I'm a beginner myself and I also have no idea what art schools in the US require. However I know that they cost a ton of money and it might not be well spent when it comes to life after college. I think it's great that your mum is encouraging you to do something that interests you and I also understand that she worries if you haven't shown a particular inclination towards anything yet. But imho the most important question, maybe even more important than the skill level, is: Do you want to be an artist? And not just in the sense that you enjoy doing art, but do you want that as a career? And what kind of art career interests you? I can imagine there are different sets of skills required for e.g. fine art, graphic design, concept art, animation etc. But to work as an artist and make a living of it, there are probably even more things required that don't necessarily have anything to do with art - self-discipline, being able to be creative under pressure, self-marketing skills, networking, a strong vision and I think above all an iron will to succeed in such a difficult area. There are a ton of artists out there and only a fraction can pay their bills with what they earn with it. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I don't want to discourage you, but I think it's good to keep in mind that a college education is more than just doing stuff you like. It's your first step into your future and career, especially in the US where it often involves a big amount of student debt that needs to be paid off with the earnings from your future job. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If art is your absolute passion and you have your family's support (also financial), then go for it. You definitely show creativity. But if you like art, but you also like.. I don't know... biochemistry, I'd say go for biochemistry. ;) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Personally I have two master degrees in fields that I was very interested in, but that aren't exactly sensible (not art, but humanities) and let me tell you that now at age 30 with the very real lack of job prospects in front of me I wish I'd have been less naive about it back then.

I wouldn't necessarily call her a bumbling fool, but just like Turnbull, she has certainly shown some terrible judgment at times.

&gt; There are plenty of for profit companies that pride themselves on delivering quality goods and services. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ What everyone here is forgetting is there is a difference between a private company, and a public one.

I'll admit I'm no lawyer or any kind of expert in this. I also suspect that the HOA will try to lowball a *reasonable* settlement. But my question is about the public-justice aspect of this. What if LAOP says, ok, their money offer is fine, but I can't accept the confidentiality clause they're trying to impose on me? I insist on knowledge of these events being made public because it's in the public interest that people be warned? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ What would a judge do in that situation?

We unplugged the relay and started the car and it still idled a little rough but no where near as bad. We put the relay back in and started it and it almost stalled and the revs were going up and down.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Assuming it't the OVP relay then 
I mostly just meant the dream-like quality.  There were times in that episode that I was convinced it was either a dream or another of Elliot's hallucinatory version of reality.  A lot of the shots, like the one following the glowing safe-t cup cone atop the Oycecream truck, or the up-down POV cuts.  The silence of some of the scenes like the mosque, even the dialogue, especially in the theatre with the surreal almost fourth wall argument about time travel and cause and effect in BTTF.  It was just so different than other episodes, it almost verged on indulgence it was so artsy, like that final beautiful scene with the door between Elliot and Angela.
Thank you so much :) I really enjoyed this compliment :)

More importantly, is it *Knife and Fork* or *Fork and Knife*. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The latter irritates me.
Yeah the internet is one example of the power and influence of government. I want to caution though against the potential leap that only the government could have done this basic research or built this infrastructure. The state can do powerful things because the state has colossal resources it took from private interests. You highlight just how potent the state is by correctly acknowledging that it was through military spending - *through spending on coercive forces*. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The mixture of our society could be likened to cooking and if the state were an ingredient it'd be a bit like garlic or habaneros. It only takes a little bit to really change things. The interesting thing is if you don't really like the taste of garlic then you can tolerate a little bit and just grumble. But when some guy advocates that everyone at the table should add another two tablespoons of garlic to their dish that's when some *free market* types are like *Hey! Hey!*. Just because some even the majority like a thing brings into question if the tastes and preferences of the few matter. That's where we lay on the pendulum.

I was trying to pick towns close to Pontiac which had busy restaurant scenes. Maybe booming isn't the best word, but those places draw a hell of a lot more people than Pontiac does. Any of the good Pontiac joints would do much better in either of those towns. Hate the burbs all your want, but Pontiac just isn't showing any signs of being a hot spot for dining.

Damn, even I could come in last in medical school for that kind of offer.
&gt; ...but no mass shootings. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I don't know what to tell you man. You just seem less interested in the number of people who die than *how* they die.  *Thank goodness my son was shot in a dark alleyway and not at a concert!* said no mother ever.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; But stricter gun laws do have a correlation with fewer gun deaths, overall  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Sure, if gun deaths were the only thing I cared about. But that's not how it works. If you pass a gun control law, and it reduces gun homicides. Ok, cool, but how did it effect overall homicide rates? If it made no effect then you can assume that simply removing the guns from law-abiding citizens didn't have much effect on criminals who break the law anyways. And it would be very strange if you next mentioned, *I prefer people to be shot over knives.* If the overall homicide rate didn't change as a result of gun control, then I would say it failed and I would rather home owners have access to guns.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; You seem pretty good with research so I assume you're making the old Chicago argument purely in bad faith.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ No, because you didn't pay attention the right parts of my comment. Again, pay attention to how gun laws have effected overall homicide rates, not just gun deaths. If I magically remove all guns away from criminals but the homicide rate doesn't change, it means they're just using different tools. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The mere presence of guns doesn't create lawlessness, if that was the case then Switzerland, Israel and Norway would have murder rates similar to the U.S., and places like Ireland, Scotland, Mexico, Jamaica, Bermuda, Bahamas and Sri Lanka would have low rates. Neither is true. Guns aren't the issue. Crime drives those numbers. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Despite having a very high rate of private gun ownership, Switzerland has very little gun violence. Swiss gun homicides stood at 0.2389 per 100,000 residents in 2010 despite the fact that they are third in the world in terms of numbers of firearms owned by private individuals. This figure is among the lowest in the world. It has less to do with the availability of the guns and more to do with the culture and values of the people using them.  _back_to_line_

I understand it's a matter of perspective, and on that note this I'd state that this is actually the worst lease experience I've had, so I guess I'm spoiled? However, this is not r/perspectiveadvice so I'll move on from that. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It's not just paying 'the one month', though. I would be paying January rent + this so called 'Opt-out' fee, so we're up to $2,190. Plus the utilities, which I'd feel lucky if those managed to stay under $100 at all. If it doesn't rent by February 1st, throw another $1095 on there. So on and so forth. I genuinely do not understand why I cannot cut a check for $2190 on the 1st and walk away, why am I paying extra to break the lease but still being held to the lease?

Why a step in the wrong direction? I actually think the contrast to the Marvel films is not a bad thing. And i don't mean *grittiness* or stuff like that.

There is a time and place for that, but not in every single movie and at every climax of the story.

That is the case throughout the entire game, weapons can drop slightly above or below, except in OP where they can drop at your level or below. What I'm talking about is the scaling. Different thing. OP was asking about whether gear drops scale in UVHM. So what I said is absolutely correct. 
Right.  We want legal, skilled immigrants.  Japan‚Äôs immigration system seems great.
I'm not sure I get the question. Do you mean something where there was an intent to plagiarize but the source material was also not original? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ This is something you see strangely often in research. At least a few times I can recall a paper has been retracted for being a plagiarism of a paper that itself was retracted due to plagiarism. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It's not an incredibly common thing but it happens more than most researchers would like to admit.

I live in Kentucky, and tried Googling the minimum amount but wasn't able to find the answer. I really do appreciate your help however. I literally felt like my world was about to fall apart. Would they really be so misleading in threatening to take me to small claims court and freeze my bank accounts if they had no intention on doing so in the first place?
I don't know of anything lore wise but it better look like a crab.

Can you provide links to how to root and flash Android One? I've been scouring XDA, and I haven't come across a way to flash Android One.
That's the spirit. You had me hooked enough to hang in there to the end so at least you can come up with a compelling idea. Running it through a good word processor would go a long way in cleaning it up.
Oh, you.
There's something kind of special about both Gen IVs and the VR6. I was kind of toying with the idea of an MKV R32 as well, but somehow they just aren't as appealing despite being very cool cars.
Well you have a neat sounding elaborate theory on K-selected econiche and whatnot that doesn't seem to hold much water if you try to apply it to some of the fastest growing groups. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If we want to raise the fertility of modern West than we sure could look into those scions of conservative values groups and learn a thing or two of what actually works before we double down on the progressive bloodletting that may look like it makes sense on the surface, but it's just obvious pseudoscience if you dig just a tad. Especially since preying on those groups in hopes to steal some of their kids on our side doesn't seem to be as promising anymore as it used to.
I like that.  Loving the void.  I know for sure I want to get back into some more self care.  I'm more able to cope when I'm not burning out.

Yea I am so excited for this.  I hope fox caves so they next major one can be galactus and it would be a perfect time to introduce the fantastic 4 to the marvel universe.  
Maybe, but then they'd have to deal with having different types of light. Right now it decreases 1 for every block, but then each light block would have to *remember* what it's source was

nvm fixed it
This is purely my opinion and comes from someone with great respect for Silva so I hope you don't take it the wrong way.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I think he is a very very good player, but doesn't do enough when his team is playing poorly. He would have a lot more PFA team of the years and probably Balon D'or votes if City were more dominant in the league. Yeah he's great this season and every season win the league. But seasons where City doesn't do well he isn't among the best in the league. And I'm not sure if thats more down to him or down to city (if he played for say Barcelona, would he be more dominate?)
I'm not expecting you to defend him. I'm telling you that he is acting unbecoming of someone his age let alone a president

Contra's time and effort, which she might be monetarily compensated for, and that money will come from the people attending (who are likely to be, you know, chuds). If she thinks her time and effort is worth that, then that's her call, and it's not really something that needs to be fixed. The biggest *resource* expended on this action by Contra is the emotional energy of dealing with her fans flipping shit because they either flatly disagree with Contra's long standing policy of talking to the (alt-)right or because they bought into some pretty unfounded rhetoric about this being an OBVIOUS set up for her to get dunked on by two hard core right wingers while raising money for anti-semites. If her fans had just kept it to *Well, I wouldn't do this, and I'm worried it's going to suck for you, but I hope it goes well and will be cheering you on from afar because I'm not giving money to a group I think sucks.* Then this could have been just another of Contra's very useful efforts to be a dissenting voice in the echo chamber directly countering the arguments of the (far) right. Instead it's a total fucking shit fest with *fans* saying they kinda hope she get's trashed, and calling her a grifter and shit. It was a shitty way to treat someone with very shitty justification.

The principle of color identity has been in the game since alpha with cards like [[Red Elemental Blast]]. Just because the term didn't exist doesn't mean there wasn't a foundation of rules and mechanics for it. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ And keeping rules consistent with other rules and game mechanics is not tautology.
Good point. I thought the report was honed from _back_to_line_ Information the region gave based on their wait times website.my bad. Wait times have definitely improved, although I will continue to hammer my point about high acuity patients not have enough space to be seen in.

I did the math on mentor. The only way it helps you is if you take it very first skill, you get skill 16 (15 non-mentor skills) slightly before you reach 15 skills without mentor. Until you reach that point, mentor is worse than useless because you're lagging behind in gaining non-mentor skills. 
And this is from 1990, just in case anyone thinks that the law was any better towards men 30, 50, 60 or whatever years ago. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Someone needs to send this shit to TFM, I would love to see it on the 420 show.

I disagree that this level of reporting - every single purchase done over 2-3 years by someone who just happened buy or sell more than $20k in *one* year - is justified by any written law. The court is in effect putting a new, legal, and already highly-regulated industry at a major disadvantage with regard to privacy, and unfairly granting a competitive advantage to the incumbent *legacy* financial system.

Agree, but she still seems to be all about highs and lows. Talking about her Oprah ah-ha moments - like on one hand that's great if she's truly figuring some things out, but with her it seems more like THIS is my personality/thing this week, until it isn't again. Maybe I'm not introspective enough but it seems like she has these revelations all the time.
I think you're referring to my post. I actually described it in slightly harsher terms than genocide. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I said the pro-choice side was the equivalent of a little over four holocausts (assuming 12 million deaths per holocaust). _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ To be fair to the other side, I also described the pro life side as wanting to force more than 150,000,000 people into second class status. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Honestly this is the issue that gives me hope for the future, if these groups can keep talking to each other and not kill each other, most of the rest of the issues we have are reasonably small.

The difference between micro atx and atx is just a few expansion slots.  You save 2 inches in height I believe when comparing the two cases.  If your board is micro-atx, it should fit no problem in either case.  However, if it's atx, it'll only fit in the 400c.

In this game I would want an AR class in the Infantry, Mountain, and Airborne divisions, and then maybe one smg in airborne, sniper in mountain and shotgun in expeditionary or maybe airborne.  I usually also like to have a melee class. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I really wish we could have as many as we want or be able to edit our classes in game.

Actually they never said exactly why they delayed it, and they haven‚Äôt taken that webpage down which they would do if they are going to redo everything. They haven‚Äôt even implied a revamp in any way in any interview. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ In fact every important person at Nintendo has committed to the smartphone app this year, which is most of what people don‚Äôt like about the service. The odds that they are scrapping that app for OS based chat is slim to none, which means most people won‚Äôt be happy with the final service. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The likely answer is that webpage is probably 99% what it will be, but people won‚Äôt accept that and be willing to talk about it until there is no hope left that Nintendo will do better. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ So early next year there will be a big meltdown on here, and at that point real conversations can be had.

It is male dominated but thats primarily because a lack of female candidates. Qualified females are highly sought after at least where I work.

No problem, man. One of the biggest things I see with new players is a lack of movement. If you‚Äôre in a window, behind a wall, behind a tree, etc always shuffle back and forth. You may not see anyone but that doesn‚Äôt mean a sniper isn‚Äôt looking at you. And when you‚Äôre running out in the open make sure you‚Äôre zig-zagging and jumping instead of just going in a straight line. It could be the difference between life and death.

Not because of the estimate, because they performed a service you didn't ask for and that they didn't tell you about. If you took your car to a mechanic for an oil change, and he comes out and says, *I know you didn't ask for it, but I rebuilt the engine. That'll be $2500.* Would you be ok with that? And I believe my state says that for mechanics, at least, the final bill cannot exceed a certain percentage of the original estimate.

As a sniper I shouldn't rely on others to soften them up to be killed that is just bad game design if a slow firing weapon also has low damage. Officer is strong, never said he was weak I just said he isn't at his full potential since there is no way to strategize or work as a team it's mostly you just happen to show up as they happen to need you.
Thanks. That's helpful. 
My faith stands, stranger. You are a warrior.
&gt;The man probably cares more about defense than every other coach in the league  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Not even remotely true. D'antoni is an offense-first coach, and he always has been. That's not to say he doesn't care at all about defense, but the fact that Ryan Anderson gets as much playing time as he does proves that it's not his priority. 
Will do. If I remember haha! Are you visiting from out of state?
I always like to make sure posts I find aren't trolls. I used to run a page that satirised pseudoscience so I got pretty good at knowing what's a fake. I also checked her personal page. Full of cray. And it's not uncommon, if a parent who got custody is not properly caring for the health of the child, in this case refusing vaccines, that the other can get custody to protect the child, as in this case.
Make everyone wear it in a bun and hide their mouths behind a mask. Head animations problems solved and budget can be reallocated to the implementation of STARSbucks for the purchasing of saveroom lootchests.
There was a fairly uncommon AD&amp;D sourcebook literally called the worldbuilders guide book. With it you can procedurally generate an entire world using dice and charts. It provides for cosmology (does your world sit on the back of an elephant riding a turtle or is it like our  own?), It provides for more or less random generation of landmasses, oceans, biomes, plate techtonics, weather patterns, cultural demographics, economics, trade routes, etc. It touches on generating your worlds history (with random charts to help spur creativity), encounter tables. Honestly it does a lot, with varying degrees of accuracy and success. It's a great spring board to world building. _back_to_line_   _back_to_line_ edit: link here  https://www.amazon.com/Builders-Guidebook-Advanced-Dungeons-Dragons/dp/0786904348

What are your opinions on electoral reform? Just want to see how much of a hypocrite you are.
I‚Äôm guessing your either black or Latino since your scared of white people, there‚Äôs no way you can be white unless there‚Äôs something wrong with you no offence, that like me (being white) and saying. I‚Äôm scared of white people and they should all die... I‚Äôm one of them. So believe the KKK will not be coming after you just in case you are white. Secondly I live in the U.K. where the liberal government in Europe sold everyone out, we get a shit Ton of terrorist attacks here and it‚Äôs all because of these so called refugees that have invaded our lands and the government being too much of a pussy to do anything about it so they don‚Äôt sound as racists. You have no idea how much I would give to have someone like trump defending ME! not the muslims and if your so naive about not having sharia in your country statistics speak for them selfs if a normal Muslim family have 6 kids which they do give or take and British or American have say 2-3 kids then further down the line maybe not in your or my lifetime but Muslims will become a majority and you know what they say government is for the people, by the people right? Well guess what... they want sharia and they will be the majority so you or your kids will be able to do fuck all to stop it. Trump is saving your traditions if your scared of white people come to London and get run over by a car or bombed by the muslims, as the Muslim mayor here says ‚Äú its part and parcel of living in a big city‚Äù ‚úåÔ∏è

*Little squirrel brain* sounds about right. I love how he hit Cammer no less than three times before realizing he even had the transmission in Reverse. I get the feeling this guy has velcro shoes.
Well to be honest he was acting just a little more boisterously than his usual self. His lecturing style is very animated and I didn't really notice him slurring any words. He leaned up against the chalkboard a lot but his normal teaching style is so flamboyant I didn't really notice an extreme difference. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Now that he was arrested, I'm guessing he's come in a little drunk a lot and I just got accustomed to it.
Yikes. I was not trying to be aggressive with you, so I'm a little puzzled by your vehement reaction. I don't worship him as a hero, I see him as a human being. And in my experience people who've spent thirty years doing something have their particular methods and reasons and generally know what they're doing... They're not to be underestimated. People don't typically do the same thing for decades without some passion or sense of duty. It happens, but it's not altogether common. So, yes, the idea that McCain is some feeble, spineless idiot seems unlikely.

What are you talking about?? Supply side is another term for trickle down! It has been since the term was coined. Saying otherwise is pure propaganda. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Edit: Straight from David Stockman, Regan's director of the OMB who is credited with bringing supply-side into mainstream Repub thinking: _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;*I mean, Kemp-Roth [Reagan's 1981 tax cut] was always a Trojan horse to bring down the top rate.... It's kind of hard to sell 'trickle down.' So the supply-side formula was the only way to get a tax policy that was really 'trickle down.' Supply-side is 'trickle-down' theory.* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Stockman

Sounds like times have changed for the better, in your continent at least anyway, it's really lovely to hear that people can go to school now and be openly and exactly who they are, it's the healthiest environment to learn in.  _back_to_line_ I am a bit worried to see how much segregation is occurring in Britain at the minute, the races are separating their communities in the inner cities, and it's apparent when we see issues in school.  _back_to_line_ I think I missed the nerd Renaissance by a few years sadly, I really would've enjoyed talking about all the stuff that I was interested in at school, instead of hiding in the Library for the first three years reading science fiction novels.  _back_to_line_ I think that's true about the violence, you could get away with the little stuff like pushing and shoving in my time, but when my bullies wound me up all day and I got myself into a full on fight with one of them, I was warned that I would be suspended if it happened again. That's one of the reasons why I've sworn off violence except for when I have to protect myself or others.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Oh wow, now I understand what all that talk about Freshman and Sophomore years are all about! Been wondering about that for bloody years, cheers for that mate.  _back_to_line_ It does seem incredibly different to ours, as we have play school/nursery for under fives, primary school (years one through six) for 5 to 11 year olds, and secondary school(years seven through eleven) for 11 to 16 year olds where we sit our GCSE exams, and you can apply to the last two years at school or college to sit your A levels. Note that college is for A level studies and practical work training like carpentry, farming, plumbing, electrical engineering etc, you'll need to pass your A levels to get into a University to go for the higher level education there.  _back_to_line_ Personally I had to get out at 16, I always hated school and sitting in classes anyway, and to be honest I've learned a hell of a lot more with the internet in my twelve years since leaving than I ever did there.

As I said, almost all standard vaccines are 100% free provided you get them on schedule. DPT, measles, rubella, Japanese encephalitis, hib, TB, chicken pox, hep B, pneumococcal...  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Most cities provide free doctor's visits for children too, though it depends on the municipality to what age and extent. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I don't know any other parents that didn't vaccinate their kids.  Obviously, that's not a representative sample so I went to see what I could find. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Per [this research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4300546/): _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; Japanese rates of **routine vaccinations** are among the highest in the world. For example, in 2013, the rate of vaccination with three doses of DTP in Japan was estimated to be &gt;99.5%, compared with 94% in the United States. Despite prior challenges with rubella coverage, in 2013, 95% of eligible Japanese children reportedly received one dose of rubella vaccine compared with 91% in the United States. [...] On the other hand, **voluntary vaccines** have lower rates of administration than routine vaccinations. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ [More info from WHO](http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary/countries?countrycriteria%5Bcountry%5D%5B%5D=JPN) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ In other words, there's a big distinction between standard and voluntary vaccines. When it comes to standard vaccines, the ones that are given for free, Japan is on par with or even slightly exceeds the US.  Rates are lower with the few voluntary vaccines (rota, flu, mumps) that cost money. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Again, not that it's perfect.  There are historical gaps in vaccine coverage when vaccines got pulled for safety reviews that cause issues. There was a rubella outbreak a few years ago. But then, there were measles outbreaks in California a few years back too that were directly linked to parents not vaccinating.  So it's not like that's a wacky, *Crazy Japan*-exclusive thing.

How so? If I recall correctly, the only force users to ever use the darksaber was the mandalorian jedi, Maul and Ezra. Almost everyone else, pre-Viszla etc. Where not force sensitive.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The darksaber is just a symbol and a more dangerous forcepike/electrostaff.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Not only would Sabine being force sensitive make her way more powerful than Ezra in every way (as that‚Äôs the only thing Ezra has over sabine), it wouldn‚Äôt make sense. Even if she kept the darksaber, she can't be force sensitive for the sake of the balance between the primary characters. 
Completely serious.
Nah, the graphics are not *that* bad.  Just a little out of date. Plus, you can install texture mods and whatnot and it'll be pretty damn good.  Since it's old it runs on a potato of a PC as well, so you don't have to worry about your mods blowing up your frames.
Kpop is pretty much the worst example of fans being fuckin' crazy. Blood cookies, blood letters, PERIOD BLOOD IN ALL THE THINGS, being run off the road in the tour van by fans, fans break into the dorm or hotel rooms so they can set up wireless cameras to spy on the singers, one female singer was actually grabbed in the middle of a performance with her group by a man who somehow got backstage and literally rushed out to try and carry her off. I was also reading about girls who shave their heads and dress as men to sneak into the men's room in the hopes of finding the singers so they can demand autographs.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ One female group right now is getting constant bomb threats. Every time they have a public appearance, live performance, whatever - some guy calls in a bomb threat and they have to clear the building. They know who is doing it, but apparently the guy is in Canada, and they don't have an extradition policy with SK. And because you never know when it will go from being a hoax to being the real deal, they have to follow protocol every time. Cancel the event, evacuate the building, sweep for bombs. Every damn time. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ This twit melting down over her hard drive and sending blood cookies isn't as bad as it could be, but she doesn't sound on the level either. Usually fans like this level out when they get caught or publicly shamed by someone else for being a total headcase, but your early 20's are also when lots of mental illnesses develop. This might be par for the course for her for the rest of her life.

I mean even the reserves and arsenal packs are 5x the amount of credits the technical mod packs are. You can unlock them 5x faster, which dont get me wrong, is great, they‚Äôre a great value, but my mission funds are just sitting there, and have been for three weeks. Im not asking for anything drastic. Weapon mods dont have to come outof the item store, but cant the items in the item store actually go into rotation so we dont have continuous repeats of the same category? _back_to_line_ I know folks that havent unlocked all the equipment yet because of this, and the further you get along, the more prevelant the problem becomes. _back_to_line_ The easiest fix is that if rare weapon mods are the lick this week, that next week they HAVE to be either rare weapons or rare character cards. _back_to_line_ It would benefit everyone in the long run that way, right now, this system is creating bottlenecks in already overinflated loot table.

Again, please define what you see as the job of a Democrat elected official, or any elected official for that matter. If the voters of California vote for someone who promises to oppose this administration's agenda whenever possible over Feinstein in 2018 and that official proceeds to do so, they will be doing their job as dictated by California voters. I don't agree with that, and I think every Democrat should be willing to come to the table to govern bipartisanly, but that is a two way street; the Republicans set the obstructionist precedent over the last 8 years and they, and our current president, have to pursue their partisan agenda at all costs rather than draft legislation that is palatable to any Democrats in Congress. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; Which is what I'm talking about. I've always been big on compromise because I think it's the best way to run the country, but it seems no one is doing anything to help promote it. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I'm repeating myself, but it's a two way street. Republicans have the power in both Congress and the executive now. The Democrats only card at this point is opposition. No Democrat is going to be willing to come to a bipartisan agreement unless the Republicans first show good faith that they are as well. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; I think Moore is a dangerous precedent to set, where you're guilty before proven innocent. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ He's not being convicted in a court of law; if you don't believe them despite the credibility elected officials within the Republican party have given them, then I don't know what could convince you otherwise. Regardless, those accusations aside, let's consider everything else about Roy Moore as a candidate. If elected and not removed from office, he will be on the hard right fringe of Republicans in the Senate. I doubt he'd ever be willing to come to a compromise on any topic with the Democrats. He certainly wouldn't be the one to bridge any divides in the legislature and would probably contribute to them even further. Meanwhile, Doug Jones is a fairly moderate Democrat; if he is elected and wants any chance of serving another term, he will have to moderate his beliefs even further to reflect the will of Alabama's voters, he *would have to be bipartisan*. How is that not the right precedent to set? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ For the record, California's open primary system effectively prevents this choice (the general will surely come down to Feinstein and an even more liberal/oppositional Democrat), but if the candidates for the California senate came down to an oppositional at all costs Democrat and a Republican who promises to oppose the extremes of the Republican agenda and at least attempt to bridge the divides, I'd probably support the latter. Additionally, I'd happily support a Kasich/Hickenlooper ticket over one with Warren on it in 2020.

Oh yeah, there is no doubt the DM is handling this very poorly.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ But based on the information the OP gave, specifically  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; Whenever we encounter enemies, I *always* try to manipulate them first if the opportunity arises, instead of just engaging in a full on brawl. For example: the party came across 2 Ogres and 4 Orcs guarding a cave entrance. We hadn't been spotted yet, so I *told the party to sit tight* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; *And I did this whenever I had the opportunity* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Those are pretty big red flags to me of a player monopolizing the story. Unless they have the other player's buy in, which it doesn't seem like they do. The fact that OP sometimes fails at grabbing the spotlight doesn't change the fact that he's trying to grab the spotlight.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Which is why my guess is the passive-aggressive insight checks against OP are caused by them not liking OP/OP's PC.

I love Kubrick but enjoyed the book's ending a lot more. I was really sad when I found out Anthony Burgess the author hated the fuck out of the movie and wished he had never even wrote the book because the film basically had the opposite message of his book.

If you never played D1 you will have a biased opinion on the matter. To call a game a sequel and put a 2 on the title with no innovation and take back features the hard core fans from D1 waited forever for is a slap in the face to the loyal user base. To then charge another $60 for the *sequel* that is yes better than Vanilla D1 but worse off than D1 after all the DLC and changes made over the years. They back tracked to appeal to such a minuscule percentage of casuals it has ended up in the position they are in now. Where most are stuck with no end game and concurrent players are dropping like flies because the game has no replay value at the moment. To have to wait another possible year to yet again have a game worth playing after already enduring the cycle before is inexcusable. Is what some of the things in this post outlandish? Sure, but there still needs to be major changes to core aspects of the game for it to have a decent life cycle.
It's eleven years old _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I don't think that a good enough reason not to know Haruhi if you're actually into anime.  Cowboy Bebop was made when I was about four, but I've still seen it. Or to use other examples, I've seen laurel and Hardy and that was made before my parents were born...
I worded that a bit poorly in the intro, I in no way wanted you to feel bad for me or make it seem like you hurt me, it sucked to read at first of course but it really helped me and like I said I'm trying really hard to improve my reception of criticism. Thanks so much for giving me another chance on the video and checking it out, your points about sound as well are really interesting and once again something I definitely didn't think of. I'll definitely tag you and hit you up for ideas and brainstorming some time :D Thanks again for your detailed responses and glad this newer version was a bit better than the original. And let me know if you start a channel, I'll gladly sub as it sounds like you have some real knowledge on the game.
Fuck these bots.
That's insane. How did that idiot fall through the cracks?
Yeah, I thought this might be the case... But if data doesn't fit with the trend, then I'll have to analyse it and make a judgement whether or not it was done the other way - I really should've double checked and fixed it beforehand, but it's good that people are realising it as it gives me hope that people really are reading it and taking in what it's about. Though again, it's my fault if people do assume it's the same, and I'll be putting so in the report (basically my proofreading skills are least to be desired) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I really want to do Pok√©mon now everyone has such a passion for it, I might run a similar survey over the summer after I've graduated and see what kind of results it does get. I'd have adored to do it in this survey, but it is something that I could go into much more detail about, so I wouldn't want to overshadow the other games in this survey. Everyone is suggesting such good ideas, like with Horizon Zero Dawn as well, as that was my initial idea but the more people talk about it the more I want to do it... So you may one day see more surveys from me on this topic!

Feels like you are literally inviting people to take the lane from you.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I'd ride on the right-hand 1/3rd point, if someone comes across I get two choices.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Hugging the yellow lane limits you to a single choice and invites them. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 
&gt; I'm essentially an emotion savant. I'm super, super sensitive to other people. For me, feeling out a person's feelings, even when they're hiding it seemingly well, is as easy as a side glance. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Isn't this called mind reading? (As defined in cognitive behavioral therapy.) This is you assuming you know how people feel, fueling and corrupting your own internal monologue about how people see you. The truth is, not even a trained psychologist/psychiatrist can do this and must rely on self reporting. Moreover if you get some idea of how someone feels into your head, then they contradict you, you may feel they are being untruthful/deceitful causing even more internal mayhem. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;  You see, I'm great at other people and their feelings, but am horrid at my own. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ This seems like a contradiction as one's own feelings are often dictated by how one assumes other people feel. We have very little control about how our own feelings go, but being aware of how we make assumptions about other people can affect our reactions (over time, with much difficulty and pain and age). _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Classic BPD mind-fuckery at work here (speaking from experience of a closely related condition). _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Has your psych put you on any drugs or cognitive therapy? I've had great success with lamotrigine.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Your comment about side glances rung a bell. Before getting professional help I had reached a point where I could 'sense' people's feelings, or even if they were looking at me, in my peripheral, but when I turned around they weren't actually looking like I thought they were. It was literally my own projection. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Have you ever been out and caught your own reflection in a window, or heard a recording of your own voice and been surprised at what you see/hear? How we look, act and sound (come across) is often completely at odds with how we feel. I hear recordings of my own voice when I think I'm being nice, and I'm being loud and confrontational. I feel chill and at and ease and catch my reflection in a train window and look like a nervous wreck. This is all at the root of most human drama. We can live with someone our whole lives and completely misinterpret what their inner world is like, never mind how we assume we come off to other people.
I mean maybe if he saw *Bryant* and thought it was Dez. Still a pretty bad 1st rounder though. Even Autodraft would've passed on both of them.

Is there a spells per day in 5e like there was in 3.5e? There is a wizard and a druid in this 5e campaign.

Found the image somewhere on Facebook and then me and a friend came up with a caption
Since he says *stochastic movement won't let it dodge a laser,* I assume he means distances at which dodging a fast projectile is possible, i.e. hundreds of meters at least. If the laser has an area of 1cm^2, that's plenty of factors of 10 once it reflects off the drone.
Yeah he found out, but he'd still be wondering who this new Batman is.

Here's what was going on inside the drive with that notch. Effectively, the notch would let a finger move into position, signaling that the disk was writable. If you put tape over that notch, the finger would simply ride on the outside and considered the disk to be read-only. This was how you kept from overwriting/deleting important files.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Also, official titles like games and programs didn't have any notches in the disk, again signifying that it was a read-only disk. Sometimes we'd get floppies in the mail or in a magazine like this, notch them, and have a free writable disk.

Most occlusives are non comedogenic so they shouldn‚Äôt clog your pores but some people have had adverse efects so like the other person said you should patch test if your skin is sensitive. I use an occlusive to keep all the good stuff in my skin because occlusives act as barriers that don‚Äôt really penetrate your skin but rather sit on top of it. Basically what I do is after I‚Äôve put on my moisturizer (and oil at night) I‚Äôll rub about a nickel sized amount of aquaphor in my hands and press that on top of my skin adding extra to where I get really dry and flakey. In the morning just rinse off or dab off with a tissue :) I also use it after my moisturizer in the morning before my sunscreen but if your skin isn‚Äôt super dry this probably isn‚Äôt necessary! _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Edit:: forgot to mention if your skin isnt very dry or youre really acne prone you dont need to use a nickel sized amount, probably a pea sized amount would be fine.. again i just use more because my skin is super dry!

I look at a lot of coins and think, how does this coin make me money and a lot of them fall flat on that.  How does dash make coin holders money?  By restricting supply and paying large stake holders in more Dash, but what if people decide Dash coin is not worth what people are paying for it?  Bitcoin is the same thing to a degree, but bitcoin holds the important entry into the market.  It‚Äôs the granddaddy and proof of concept going 9 years strong and pairs with everything else.  9 years is an eternity in this space.  This is one reason I like taas, even if the coin has stagnated.  It pays dividends based on performance.  I think it is a good model.  A lot of these coins just sound like nonsense.  I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not seeing the complete picture though.

I agree, also as a Norwegian in Oslo I see many kids of muslim immigrants rebell against the values of their parents wanting to enjoy the same amount of freedom their Norwegian peers enjoy. Claiming the right to marry on their own terms or wear what they want. There seem to be quite a bit of assimilation, though maybe not as much as I would like. Also the left In Norway seems much more willing to challenge the values of minoreties. Child protection services in Norway are challenging forced marriages and other practices
Well that is rather disappointing

I actually rather enjoyed the first game‚Äôs story. It wasn‚Äôt mind-blowing, but I enjoyed it well enough. Obviously the second game wasn‚Äôt too great on that front, but it is completely understandable as to why. If I remember correctly, the original concept for the sequel didn‚Äôt even contain Starkiller, the main protagonist was actually to be Yoda. But due to the devs getting thrown on a super tight time constraint, they had to scrap that idea and cobble together a story and bring back Starkiller
I am talking about all of their bad decisions. They introduced currency noone wanted - essence, we begged to revert changes, because rng grind is nothing we like or approve. Did they listen? They did - they gave us slightly more new currency - there you go morons *we are listening*. Now after 20 patches they removing it *yay*.  _back_to_line_ Tbh i was very excited about whole first part of the changes. No essence, cards are free, but wait another freaking rng. Tell me how does this sub reacts every time comes to introducing new rng. Are we happy with it? Likely no - so tell me how do they listen introducing even more of it. And this one, mate, is radiciulosly idiotic.  _back_to_line_ Balance changes, don't even let me begin with. On the side note, funny how i see some changes coming right from *pls buff /instert champion here/* rants on this sub (name it ying or damba new legendary for instance). So did they listen? I call it rather lack of creativity of their team, specially when it comes to handle huge system changes.  _back_to_line_ Reasuming, you guys believe Hi Rez will change new card system they introduced which is imo stupid af and ruins Paladins identity?

This is from Marxists.org since I can't Ctrl-F my Penguin Edition. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Chapter 14 Section 4 _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Here he talks about capitalism in general _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;Since the production and the circulation of commodities are the general pre-requisites of the capitalist **mode of production**, division of labour in manufacture demands, that division of labour in society at large should previously have attained a certain degree of development. Inversely, the former division reacts upon and develops and multiplies the latter. Simultaneously, with the differentiation of the instruments of labour, the industries that produce these instruments, become more and more differentiated. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Chapter 15 Section 1 _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ A revolution of production from one epoch of capitalism to another _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;In manufacture, the revolution in the **mode of production** begins with the labour-power, in modern industry it begins with the instruments of labour. Our first inquiry then is, how the instruments of labour are converted from tools into machines, or what is the difference between a machine and the implements of a handicraft? We are only concerned here with striking and general characteristics; for epochs in the history of society are no more separated from each other by hard and fast lines of demarcation, than are geological epochs. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ ... _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;Here and there, long before the period of manufacture, and also, to some extent, during that period, these implements pass over into machines, but without creating any revolution in the **mode of production**. It becomes evident, in the period of modern industry, that these implements, even under their form of manual tools, are already machines. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ ... _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;A radical change in the **mode of production** in one sphere of industry involves a similar change in other spheres. This happens at first in such branches of industry as are connected together by being separate phases of a process, and yet are isolated by the social division of labour, in such a way, that each of them produces an independent commodity _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Search here for more examples: https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ EDIT: Honestly I think the first quote I pulled kind of explains it. Tools are the defining characteristic of the manufacturing mode of production and the machine is that of the industrial. Quantitative changes of the number of machines that exist for making other machines eventually becomes the qualitative change in modes of production. At a certain point, machinery self-hosts, completing the transformation. The mode of production can refer to small periods like manufacture and industry, or larger ones like capitalism and communism. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I guess the other part of my question still stands: What revolutions in the mode of production have occurred since Marx's time? What were the conditions that brought them about?

Well he was an accountant...
What even is lipstickalley, sounds like some fangirl site, some really deluded kids come here or just one or two with their alts,  ehh not my problem what they think lol
[](/cadanceohyou) Nah... You found one of the drones. But you didn't want to tell until you knew what they were. So you went to research it.
Thanks! Thinking of going with [this](https://www.futbin.com/18/squad/1896811) during the WL, if he doesn't work at CB I'll put Bailly back in and leave Kola as a sub. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I don't think I could use him as a LB, too slow and agile for how I use my fullbacks. Could work really well as a defensive minded LB. Leave the RB for creating width. Never used Blanc but he looks really good. Defensive workrates so he can stay back a bit but also good attacking stats so when he's in that position he'll do well. 3* WF might be a bit of an issue
LOL.  This is good one. :-)
And I never jest.
definitely, one of our Swedish brethren who goes to the games said he will benefit from another year to develop as a centre
Ooh I like the sound of this! That's so true too about recipes, the ability to play by feel is vital for good cooking 
Many, many of them are pay what you will as well. So like, get some good music, toss a cool band a few bucks, everyone feels good.
Two main factors for me are the good use of material design and media previews. It's ad supported, but you can optional pay to get those removed. 
- How do you know the same people who complained bought the game? This sub had an influx of about 40-50k people, most likely from r/gaming, after the original cost of Luke and Vader came to light and EA made their pride and accomplishment speech. I‚Äôve personally seen a lot of people on this sub in recent times saying they never intended to buy the game anyway because they weren‚Äôt into Battlefront/Star Wars. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ - EA have also had this license for a few years now. Were you posting actively on this sub then about their bad practices? What amuses me is the fact that this influx of non-players weren‚Äôt here when we first found out that the game would have lootcrates about a year ago. It was literally only because of the hero cost, though every post thereafter was about loot crates and microtransactions. I don‚Äôt even agree with P2W concepts but I get really tired of people who have left it until now to start preaching to the sub.
I agree and was going to make this same point.  Yes there is physical value in gold and silver but not nearly to the value of it today.  When was the last time you bought something with either?  A *silver* dollar is still only worth a dollar. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The infrastructure to trade on it simply does not exist, but the gold standard is still very much alive.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Bitcoin is no more valuable or *real* than paper money, and no more or less a collectible than the metals that value that paper. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The scary thing for developed countries and and businesses are that Bitcoin is global and self-regulating.  Nobody controls it.  You can't just *print more* Bitcoin to stimulate an economy.  Hell that's scary to everyone.  But it is certainly becoming a serious threat to everything we have come to know about money.
Lol best of luck. Think I'm calling it quits. Save for the next.
Coundn't tell ya!

This was above and beyond other tax perks. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ This is also fraud against the consumer _back_to_line_ &gt; _back_to_line_ Starting in 1991, the phone companies went state-to-state to get changes in state laws, known as ‚Äúalternative regulations‚Äù to charge customers for the replacement of the copper wires that were part of the state-based utility, like Verizon New Jersey, with a fiber optic wire capable of 45 Mbps in both directions, the standard speed for broadband in 1992. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ How you can defend this action or why it needs to be spelled out for you I just can't understand.  _back_to_line_

I owned and sold that belt a few years back. The Georgia wcw tv one. Garvin sold it on eBay back in like 2005.
That happened to me in the beginning, not really sure why. I now move to another map after paying the loan, with the theory being that loading another map forces the game to autosave sooner and my loan progress will not be lost. I think I was closing the game right after paying some of the loan off and that is why it did not save that I had paid.

&gt;  I wish there was some other form of progressing life skills without having to leave the screen when I'm having fun or wanting to play.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Life skill sadly isn't just AFK, if it was i'd do it. Its too much work. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; I am not hitting the wrong stuff _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Genderlocked? AFK? first one is something barely anyone cares about, the second thing is a positive most of the time. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; Variety in that would bring more players since it would expand the *To do things* other than grinding 24/7 when at the monitor. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I could sit here all day telling you the things you could do in the game besides grinding. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;  Then there is the single player. Where there is practically no group content ingame. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Ever heard of the kama temple? ever did PvP? ever heard of savage rift? ever heard of RBF? ever heard of arena of arsha? ever heard of idk leveling together? mirumok destroyer offin? valtarra? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Yes your complaint was valid a long time ago.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; Why can't I play a male ranger or a female berserker for example. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ For sure but i'm willing to bet that aspect is not a game breaker for most people. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; Things like that is why it's never gonna be the next great thing. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Except it is already the 'next great thing', its the best action MMORPG on the market right now. Thats why you see it pop up on MMO sub so much now. Thats why you see so much hate from this sub about it, because it always pops up constantly.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;  (Let's not even mention the cash shop) *cough or the electricity bill monthly subscription of 10‚Ç¨ for leaving your PC on all the time for said AFK progress.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Good thing AFK 'progress' is the weakest in terms of progressing for the game. Also please do talk about the cash shop, a game that now costs 5$. You probably spent more on other MMOs than i have spent personally on BDO and i'm in the top in terms of player wealth/gear and so on. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; Anyhow you are being in the defensive. If you truly enjoy the game you shouldn't let other people opinions about it affect you. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Not sure why you're bothered by me arguing over a game that i enjoy? most people seem to not have any solid arguments and same goes for you.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; Oh and yeah one time my guild *mate* left his character on for 4 days straight progressing his strength due to having to travel. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Progressing his strength? if you mean gearingup/getting stronger you cannot because you actually have to take care every 2 or 4 hours if you're processing for example. If you mean the actual strength stat... you are pretty much a joke at this point.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;  So i'm not sure about dumb but no matter how insignificant it is it's still progress without touching the game is it not?  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Its not significant progress that people would rely on, you are claiming that all people are doing is AFK? Lol. Yes you can get some very insignificant progress by AFK. Which is a good thing, you go to work/sleep/study and you can still gain something. So thats great, but here is the 'trick' you're doing. You're implying that is all the game is about, you're implying thats all people do. You're implying that people aren't playing because of AFK progress. Sadly that is not true since AFK progress is not a 'thing'.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; There was no need to call names or get upset about my opinion and obviously many others about this game. We are afterall all adults here I hope (in this post). _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Uh call names? not sure what you're talking about. Are you talking about a different person? i'm upset? yea totally dude /s _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; Also not really sure on the group content but when I played with my wife few months back it was an awful experience in that department. Atleast compared to GW2 or FFXIV or even Aion. Hell even Revelation Online had more group content. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Compared to GW2 and FFXIV? Aion? those games are trash target combat. Please don't do any comparison because they would always look worse. I'm a person of mechanics, don't mention bad mechanic games please. As for group content, no this game is not about PvE raids. Besides that i mentioned some other group content above.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ You are hitting the wrong things bc somehow you are twisting *progressing* while AFK into a bad thing which it isn't. Somehow you think something that most people don't care about (genderlocking) is now also a big thing, which it isn't. Then finally you think there is no group content which there is.. so great. The only part that could use more work is the 3rd part but its in a good state PvP wise right now and thats all i care about. They also added more group content and things to do, you  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_

Incidentally the Russian social democrats also betrayed the revolution, but I haven't put much thought into how things would have played out if things went differently in Russia. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The German social democrats actually had not one but two chances, and both times they chose to betray the working class. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The first was then they voted in favor of the first World War and became best buddies with the ruling class, sending millions to their deaths in a pointless imperialist war. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The second was in the revolution after the war, when they sided with proto-fascists and squashed what could have easily been the beginning of a socialist Germany. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The German social democracy was the world's biggest socialist organization at the beginning of the war, and Germany was an industrial superpower. It's easy to imagine a domino effect taking off that turns country after country socialist in Europe, but even if it was just Germany (and maybe Russia, though it's uncertain if the revolution there would have taken place the same way without the massive unrest caused by the horrendous war casualties) they would have already had a better starting point than Russia did. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Class consciousness was more widespread among the workers, the already present industrial base means they wouldn't have had to alienate large parts of the population by working them to the bone to build one up, and the long democratic tradition in the party would have forestalled a degeneration into totalitarianism. If the Russian revolution had also succeeded they could have aided the Bolsheviks and steered them away from a descent into totalitarianism too. That a socialist Germany would not have become fascist goes without saying. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The conditions for a successful socialist revolution were better than at any other place or time in history, and the social democrats squandered their chance and sided with the oppressors. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The Social Democratic Party of Germany is thus to blame for all deaths of both World Wars, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, and just about 90% of all violent deaths since 1914. I know of no other organization in the history of humanity with such a high kill count.

Blackface has been used during and after slavery in America and parts of Europe, to mock black people /coloured folk / negros (i don't which I should use in English). So yes, blackface is still considered racist. he's also using an over the top accent.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I think it's sensitive material but they used it perfectly. because of how the other characters interacted with him and it's made so clear that the reason behind the blackface isn't racism, he's an over achieving actor who really wants to show that he can play anybody.

That sucks for you, but for people who haven't played on private servers, we haven't had the chance to redo the old leveling zones since they were taken from us with the Cata launch in 2010.

What greater Authority is there in a political context than the state, than the government? What other forms of Authority are there, in a *political* context than the state?  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Authority _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;a : persons in command; specifically : government _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;b : a governmental agency or corporation to administer a revenue-producing public enterprise _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/authority) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ That's not even mentioning the very simplistic view all the previous comments seem to have on Anarchy. For example in a Anarchist minority favoured Democracy it could be argued that the minorities are therefore the political *authority* as they hold more political power. From here it can easily develop into an Authoritarian Regime. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Meanwhile a Minarchist society wouldn't remove the state entirely. The political power within a Minarchy and within an Anarchy are generally less susceptible to becoming Authoritarian because it supports power to the people.

I have a 5x2cm lump that lies right over my SI joint. I saw my doctor after the back pain I was having became too severe/long lasting to just have been from exercise/poor posture.

Now with stretching, exercise and myofascial release work, which huuuurts, it‚Äôs starting to feel better. The link below does a good job of describing it.

I wish I could give you specifics, but it's very situational. Just don't be afraid to fall back early, more often people will push in when there's empty space around the middle island allowing you to farm them from further back (think second line of buildings rather than first line after the island). _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Ninja edit: also, in regards to falling back and relocating, go directly back and then cross. If you try to cross at the middle of the map you will obviously get shot easily.

Yeah, what the fuck was that about. I'm sorry my face got in the way of your bullets mr vice president.
My first answer is regarding the *small chance* it might come out someday. _back_to_line_ I'm saying small chance because the scope of the game is soo huge, that it is unlikely to be finished in the next 10 years at this rate of progress. So far CIG has designed a bunch of tools to lay the groundwork for very basic gameplay. If one is honest with the state of development, they have achieved traversal in a star system (not even between them) that works fairly well and basic combat, that's it. _back_to_line_ They are developing very impressive technology, including netcode, procedurally generated cities, seamless transitions over vast distances and whatnot. But the actual gameplay is at an absolute basic level. _back_to_line_ On the other hand, they are (supposedly) burning through their money very fast, since they expanded their studios and are employing around 500 devs and other staff at this point. _back_to_line_ So far, CR has shown that he is not willing to sacrifice his vision of the game for any practical reasons, but instead he is pushing the limits of the gaming technology to produce gaming mechanics that were never seen before at this scale. So in my opinion, CR will rather have the project fail, then to cut anything in his game. And that will be his downfall in the end. Many believe that Freelancer was only a success because CR left the company and Microsoft took over and put focus back on making an actual game, instead of trying to achieve the impossible with an ever extending scope. _back_to_line_ So no, I have somewhat lost faith in CRs ability to deliver a *finished* product before his funding runs out. We can just hope that he will get far enough with the development so we get to play at least a small part of Star Citizen. _back_to_line_ The same thing is true for the single-player campaign. This is in general separate from the public universe, but instead of finishing it, he pretty much wants the campaign to be a single-player experience inside the game engine of the public universe at this point. Which leads to the conclusion that it will never get released before all the mechanics and gameplay for the universe is ready for release too. If he had stuck to the original plan, SQ42 could have been released years ago, since the development effort would have been much smaller. _back_to_line_ In some ways, this makes sense, in others it's a wasted opportunity to get more funding for the game by releasing the first chapter without stuff like planetary landings and other heavy-tech parts of the public universe part. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ **immersion** _back_to_line_ Immersion is somewhat of a divider inside the community. Some want the universe to be like Second Life. They dream of playing this game nearly 24/7 and hope for meaningless tasks like eating, drinking, going to the toilet, actually sleeping, wasting their time in prison and whatnot. And so far it looks like this is the direction CR is taking the game. _back_to_line_ This is however very unfortunate for those, that don't have that much time to actually play the game and also want to enjoy their little time in the game that they will get. _back_to_line_ My friends and I are not opposed to immersion and realism when it comes to flight models or physically flying down to planets instead of having skippable cutscenes. It's the fact that they are starting to include so many little meaningless tasks that will be repetitive after a very short time. Imagine you have two hours to play the game with your friends. Why would you want to spend an hour of that reparing your ship, flying somewhere to refuel every 30 minutes, having to eat, drink, take a shower and maybe take care of your pet while you're at it? Instead we would much rather just play missions and have fun with the time we have! _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ **randomly generated quests** _back_to_line_ There will be hand-crafted quests, like the ones you get from Miles Eckhard at Levski in 3.0. However to fill the time in-between those main quests there will also be a lot of randomly generated ones. If done right, they will not get repetitive for a longer time, but in the end for those that play 1000s of hours it will be unavoidable. _back_to_line_ Elite:Dangerous has the same problem since there are only proc-gen missions. The main problem is that they are very linear, for example take stuff from A to B, 50% of the time you get an extra offer to take said stuff to C, etc. _back_to_line_ With some creative input, and so far I think there are some very smart people working for CIG, this will be avoided to some extend. _back_to_line_ So far, it has been shown that even a single easy mission, let's say fly to some moon and get 2 waste cargo items and deliver them somewhere else in 3.0 takes about 30 minutes. So I can assure you that running out of missions, or having them feel repetitive will take quite a while. _back_to_line_ This is also true, because in Star Citizen there will be a LOT more possibilities to create interesting missions, since there is a first person element to it. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ **sidenote** _back_to_line_ This all is of course my opinion and what I have so far gathered from friends and the groups that I am in contact with on the internet. None of this is of course representative of the Star Citizen playerbase or even a small part of it. _back_to_line_ Even if you were to make polls and start questioning backers here on reddit and on the RSI forums, you will  only ever get a response from the dedicated fanbase, not the vast majority of backers, that do not even follow the development closely, but instead are just waiting for there to be a game to be played. This is very obvious when comparing view numbers on shows like ATV or just looking at the number of regular visitors of these sites compared to the 2 million backers of course. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I hope this isn't too long an answer and my intentions are somewhat clear, since english isn't my main language and sometimes sentences get a little too complicated to read easily :D

Thanks! I never got the power suit either. Those cells must be pretty well hidden, but I want to find them without a tutorial. I've done the hanging back thing and it feels like cheating. Guess it's back to the cauldrons to search for parts.

Ya, alprazolam/other benzo powders are cheap and highly available so almost nobody makes fent presses, unlike with opiate pills where obtaining hydro/oxy codone/morphone powder is difficult, and fent is an opioid so it feels similar to other opioids while it isn't even close to a benzo feeling.

Even not being an AC fan, I suggest giving origins a shot. It's different enough and has a ton to do.  _back_to_line_ I was let down by Destiny 2, but I also played a ton of D1 and I went from only logging in on Tues in D2 to not even starting the game in over a month.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I also have a Switch so I've had a few more options for some great stuff.

From everything I've read about Mistrial on this subreddit when it was released in JP, her cover magic AOE abilities make an enormous impact on future game content.  She is probably equivalent to Rikku/Tillith/Ayaka in completing end game content.  I think that makes her worth burning tons of tickets on, even at the expense of a limited christmas banner.
That would be ashes my dude..

I injured myself pretty badly last year, sadly I can't run/jump anymore so no cardio. :( But 10k is a mix of everything, I try to get in at least one 30-60 min fast paced walk every day but it doesn't always happen. On weekends I can walk/hike more. I walk everywhere, I have a bus stop next to my house so I used to use public transport a lot, now I only use it if I don't have time. I walk to my favorite restaurants, cinema, when I am meeting up with friends, to my sister's house (it's 7km away :D) etc. But mostly it's walking around my flat (I work from home) and marching in place while brushing teeth, watching movies, cleaning dust, whatever it is. I use FitBit reminders but instead of walking just 250 steps every hour I walk as much as I can. I have a desk I can use when sitting and standing so if I am in a meeting, I will bring my desk up and march in place while meeting happens. It has done wonders for my back as well, no more stiffness and pain! And to be honest, it doesn't feel like exercising at all.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_

It won't, people here just think using addicts as an argument will be more effective than simply admitting that they just don't like it or have an abnormal issue that they should seek help for. This subreddit has often argued that they need regulations to protect them from buying bad games, despite the fact that we live in a world where you can watch an entire game be played on Youtube before ever buying it.

I think Schwartz could become a good HC if given another opportunity too. He did good things here, but he didn‚Äôt have the experience to handle the ups and downs that came his way. He‚Äôs had a chance to rethink a lot of that as a coordinator, and I definitely think his coaching has improved even as a DC since his HC stint here.
I guess either way the issue is that god made him too..... flaming?  _back_to_line_   _back_to_line_ (Apologies to my gay friends.  I'll see myself out) 
Ok so to summarize then what we are saying is the people that felt unsafe with uniformed Police were BLM group members? The reason they felt unsafe was because the BLM group members are racist and there could be possible repercussions for their hate speech?  
As you know 1.5-3k rpm is pretty up there that engine performs as a gas engine and I honestly think the weight and the way it drives is not worth the cost of doing the swap in my opinion I would personally just throw the Magnason blower on it unless you just want a diesel then by all means go for it. I'm personally not a fan of diesels unless you tow a lot. On 4x4s the weight gained is not worth the mpgs in my opinion.

Oh idk. They just have one from what I‚Äôve ever seen and that one sings a song at International.

It doesn't matter.

Yes absolutely, and I hear you... But they cant make everyone happy,  especially when appealing to hundreds of thousands of players who are mostly F2P anyway.

If you're facing off against him in 1v1, he *should* be hard to beat. That's his design, the same way it's hard to win 1v1 against Tracer, Genji, McCree, or Mei.

You should focus the troops you play first so you're not spreading the cards out to all the classes, that is unless you play each class evenly. This way, you have more fun with a souped up trooper playing games and earning credits to funnel into the other troops you might not play as often. That's the way I look at it at least.

So you like the Lagavulin....have you tried the Distillers Edition? It's almost as good as sex. 
I understand. It's really risky. Though it's funny to think people going out ratting in blinged out battleships and carriers, only to have those people who are now Titan piolets doing that same concept in Titans. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Risk and reward, if it was a garunteed Titan drop then yeah. Faction dreads and force aux IMO should be a different mechanic.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ A lot of prep goes into taking one of these things down. It's not just show up and shoot kinda deal. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Just makes me sad that these beautiful faction creatures are being stifled from existing.
Obviously i did that √† loooong time ago ;)
Okay, makes sense. According to a Wikipedia on Alcopops though, this situation is already avoided by using fermented alcohol, beer and wine, as replacement, making the alcopops legal to be sold to minors again and exempt from the extra tax. Though, according to a report by the gov, this is an insignificant phenomenon.

Fuck Nazis!
&gt;so the action of propelling the buckshot forward is equal to the recoil of the shotgun backwards, however we don‚Äôt notice recoil as much because the shotgun is way heavier than the buckshot, so it moves slower.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ You realize you just explained what I was talking about in the first place while trying to explain it to me as if I didn't know, right? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;Still buckshot is only going to hit them as hard as recoil to the chest. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ That doesn't seem correct, the main reason being that if someone gets shot in the chest with a shotgun they take way more force than the force imparted on the body that shot it. While you're right with Newton's laws, you're not considering the different mass of the objects - or rather, you think I'm not considering it even though my previous responses have to assume that mass for what I'm talking about to make any sense. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If a truly equal force were being imparted on the round, the round would never move, because the backwards force of the gun would move the exact same amount backwards as the bullet did forwards. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ However, you have to overcome a bodie's potential energy with kinetic energy in order to effect it like that. A shotgun shell weighs less than a US pound, the average adult male weighs 180. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ This is why guns work at all. A small shell like that, regardless of how fast it accelerates in one direction, doesn't have the kinetic energy to push a person to the floor by itself, it just doesn't have enough mass. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ So, the reason to put a plate in front of the barrel of the gun is to put that energy back into the shooter. If the bullet is fired, but can't leave the gun, all that energy is going to be imparted onto him, so long as the plate is heavier than he is.
That's hilarious! What a great bunch! 
Obviously, but I can still dream in my dream
Pretty sure monthly. I'd be all over that if it was monthly lol

Well, the Catholic church alone is estimated to provide anywhere from 17-34 percent of all charitable social services in this [country](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/19/frank-keating/does-catholic-church-provide-half-social-services-/). That obviously doesn't count the many thousands of non Catholic congregations in the United States. That also doesn't count the hospitals and Universities that the Catholic church runs (i think 15 of the top 100 hospitals in the country are Catholic) that provide a huge amount of charitable services (medical care and scholarships).  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ So, to answer your question, yes.

I think so. 
I think you are getting score per minute confused with Kill:Death ratio.  You get 100pts per kill in TDM, so if your spm is 2.73, then that means it takes you over 36 minutes on average to get one kill!     _back_to_line_      _back_to_line_ However, I believe in your original post you meant that your Kill:Death ratio is 2.73, which means that you get 2.73 kills on average per 1 death.

Vivien was people watching. It was always one of her favorite pastimes, and she had never had so many faces to look at before. Torches and candles on tables made the garden twinkle, like hundreds of fireflies frozen in place, still glittering and suspended in the night air.

That was, until she saw Maria's face.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Vivien began to smile, standing as her friend grew closer.

&gt; If there is no wager there is no gambling. You cannot have a wager if there is no monetary value being exchanged. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Your wager is the money you put it, the value is a random assortment of stuff you get back. Gambling has a lot of definitions, saying that its only gambling if money is involved is wrong. Whatever your opinion, in game cosmetics and game enhancing items have value. Paying to get a random bit of them is a type of gambling. Buying packs of MTG and Pokemon are definitely gambling, its just the odds are set up so that it is reliable and since no money is given as a result of opening packs it has not been legally classified under gambling laws. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; This is why skee ball is not gambling. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Ski ball is not gambling because it is a game of skill. How well you do is directly proportional to how good you are and what you get is based on how well you do. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;  there is NO DIFFERENCE between buying CARD PACKS FOR MAGIC OR POKEMON and LOOT BOXES. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ They are a form of gambling, just Magic/Pokemon cards list the rarity on the package and tell you the odds for getting the foil/whatever cards. Not only that, but each type (rare, uncommon, common etc) is produced in equal quantity. You are equally likely to get every rare in a set. As above, it has avoided being legally classified as gambling due to how it is run and the fact that the game itself is not about winning money through opening packs. Loot boxes, with the exception of those in China due to law, do not list drop %. You do not know the odds of getting what you want and the company selling them can manipulate those odds however they want. That rare you want could be a .01% drop rate while the one you already have could be 25%. It doesn't have to be % based even, they could base it on how many boxes you have purchased or how much money you've spent on the game. So loot boxes fall into that same not quite gambling category except with the possibility of much dodgier practices, especially when boxes directly impact gameplay. When it stops being cosmetic and goes into *buy 100 boxes to get the best gun* then it is extremely exploitative of human nature in the same way gambling is except you don't get any of your money back. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; VOTE WITH YOUR MONEY AND LET CAPITALISM TAKE ITS COURSE. People will not continue to make games that don't make money.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ While try, this is ultimately not going to happen. If you've been watching lootboxes over the years it's been a slope of developers trying to make more money off of their players. Mobile games have been especially exploitative of players, hiring psychologists/behavior analysts etc in order to figure out how to extract as much money as possible out of people and this mentality has been coming to Console/PC recently. This kind of manipulation causes people to spend money they don't have because it exploits human nature, it needs to get some regulation Yes, it's just a game, but at it's core so is gambling and both work on the same principals. Without laws people are just going to get exploited until there really aren't alternatives. Look at what has happened with DLC. It used to simply be large expansion packs for successful games being the norm. Then those packs turned into smaller DLC. Then DLC started being unfinished portions of the game and/or tied to preorder bonuses. Then it became about season passes so you were preordering DLC before a game even came out. It's continually getting worse. Letting the industry self regulate just means that the games where this doesn't work fail and the games where it does work double down on these harmful practices. _back_to_line_

I am glad you are happy with these laws. I am not. You are actually advocating 1984 when you say you are happy that your freedom of speech has been curtailed. It is the thought police, people saying you can or you cannot believe something. You truly are a blind sheep my friend. All ideas and beliefs must be subject to scrutiny.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I'm not naive to see Britain First is aligned with Christianity. My god man, Britain IS aligned with Christianity. The country was built on judeo-christian teachings. A group called Britain first I can only assume are in defence of these teachings. And no, you don't have to argue all religions needs to be dragged into the 21st century, if they don't teach violence or persecution then who am I to tell anyone what to do? Islam is the only one I understand that does teach violence and persecution. Now, I am a true libertarian in so far that you can do anything you want as long as it doesn't effect me. You can believe in a chocolate teapot orbiting the galaxy. Bother me? Not a jot! Unless they say that this chocolate teapot has told its followers that I am an infidel and I should die for not believing in said chocolate teapot... then I would have a problem. Guess what the Islamic chocolate teapot tells its believers...? Yes, I am an infidel and should die.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ But what you are saying is what I am saying. All major religions have had their reformations and become enlightened except one... guess which one. And more to the point, unlike other religions, Islam says you cannot change anything in the Koran at all. So we can whistle for this reformation we hope for... it just wont happen!  _back_to_line_ You suggest we should work on this as a society. Explain to me how? Without being critical of Islam? Without applying pressure to its adherents, without calling them out anytime they enact some of the more extreme aspects of their Faith? How do we get there? More to the point, how many people must die for this? Are you willing for your sister to be blown up on a bus? Your daughter to be mowed down by a van? Your father to be stabbed in the street? What number of people do you think is an acceptable price to pay to bring this (unchangeable religion) into the 21st century? For me the answer is 0. At the moment there is no end in sight. The number of dead will go up, the fear people experience daily going to work will increase, the time spent at airports waiting for security will go up. When do we say... this isnt worth it!  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ And no, Trump was absolutely correct to re tweet these things. They demonstrate what happens when you think appeasement or positive discrimination is the right answer. Look at what happened in the 1930s and Germany? That didn't turn out well did it.  It is not about widening division by re tweeting these things, it is about showing everyone, muslims and non muslims alike what this religion can debase itself to, and to show everyone that shit like this wont be brushed under the carpet. You want a multicultural society, that is fine, but these subcultures that form the multicultural society must behave and be compatible as a whole with the rest of society. So far I can only see one that is causing problems. And we must pressure all Muslims, moderate and extreme. Because we don't have access to what goes on behind closed doors in Mosques. It is not for me, who is not part of their culture to police them individually. No... the rest of society must say *Get your house in order or else!* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ When you invite people to stay in your home, you expect them to follow the house rules. if you invite a family to stay and their parents are perfectly nice, but their kids throw tantrums and start breaking stuff. Then it gets to a point where you have to say to the parents... Look, sort your kids out or you have to leave. Its not for me to punish their unruly children or sort out their parenting.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I agree with you that maybe some of Britain Firsts members are at odds with the law. On a purely societal level, I don't agree with law breaking in any form. But I also do not agree with this law. However, from what I understand Britain Firsts policies are entirely legal, and it is a few of its followers that are the ones causing trouble. I can hear you say now, but its the same with Islam. Most Muslims are peaceful etc... well yes and no. Thousands of deadly terror attacks costing millions of lives take place constantly in the name of Islam, A few rowdy Britain first supporters is not the same thing. Moreover, Britain First's political manifesto is a peaceful one that doesnt call for violence. The koran is not and calls for things that are at total odds with our multicultural society. For the life of me, i cannot understand why you support Islam and not the democratic right for people to express their political beliefs? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I disagree with you about they want to hark back to a time long gone. Yes they want to ensure that our culture remains as the guiding principle in which Britain creates and enacts its laws. But what is so bad about that? Can you tell me one non christian founded country where you would be happy to live in? What society and culture without doubt has done more to spread innovation, a system of laws and governance than ours? NONE, but people like you are complicit in letting it be watered down and changed, rather than the immigrants that come here change their behaviour to suit us, they want us to suit them. But why? Their culture obviously isn't a winning formula?  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ And one last point about radicalism. Please understand.... There is no radical Islam or moderate Islam. There is... only Islam. It cannot be changed. Check it out [Yoonus 10:64]  _back_to_line_ All you have is Muslims who follow Islam and its teachings to the letter and those who cant be bothered. Same as bible thumping Christians who wont eat fish on friday and dont beleive gays should marry vs people who like Easter eggs and put up a Christmas tree. They are on a spectrum in their belief. But the fundamental difference is... The overall example set by Jesus is to love each other, forgive each other, do not hurt each other. Mohammad... was a murdering, slave owning , paedophile with a penchant for war and torture. Do you see the difference? Come on! Do you see where radical Christians might just get a bit shouty, but radical Muslims might get a bit stabby? I dont know about you, but I would prefer to be shouted at than stabbed? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ My advise is - don't protest Britain first. Protest Islam to have a reformation. Protest the shit out of them. Because they are the biggest threat to multicultural Britain Because according to their fairy tale book... we, our society is abhorrent to them and this was laid down to them by their magic faries (Allah and Mohammad). When people care about divine law more than the law of man it is a very dangerous place to be, because they font care about prisons, ASBOs, court orders or fines. They are willing to lay down their life for what they believe in. In the words of Gary Oldman as Churchill...  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *When will the lesson be learned! You cannot reason with a tiger when your head is in its mouth!' _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 
For me it's just a real pity. The movie is so well made in many respects but not having that bit of background info in there really hurt it. And it's not fan fiction. That *is* the backstory.

Yes, model S changed a ton over the first 3 years. It probably wont change as much as the S did, but still some significant improvements.

You can get DLA and PIP currently (that's changing soon, and I don't know the levels under UC)  PIP is more then job seekers by itself, but I'll leave you to look into that lot. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ And as above, the pension ages are merging, so the later pension is getting sorted. It's best to do these slowly so people have a chance to plan for the moved retirement. I just wish the last movement hadn't been set. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I've also met people who ended up homeless after losing their job, and usually the main factor wasn't being old and male, they'd openly admit the biggest problems was substance abuse, leading to them spending too much and in some cases being what cost them their jobs
I look at it like they did then the opposite of what science is doing to dinosaurs. We saw them as giant reptiles, now they're closer to birds. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Jackals were very avian in design, now the new subspecies look like reptiles and dinosaurs. 
Didn‚Äôt they remake it?
You joke, but a podcast of NFL waterboys actually has potential. I bet there's tons of great 'fly on the wall' type stories those guys have

Do you really think that Marvel Studios cares about them?
No, it was only obvious on occasion. And those were few. The only reason why you think it‚Äôs more often is because it‚Äôs most prominent in the first scene and that being the first scene, you‚Äôll look for it. Most people I‚Äôve talked to who didn‚Äôt know, didn‚Äôt notice.
Yeah, it's a thing. I was surprised when I first heard it about it, but apparently putting a PCB in an oven at low heat for a while causes the solder to reflow fix problem joints. I've heard it works good if it's done properly. Just not sure if it's a good idea to do it with a board that has giant caps on it.
Not bad at all man

We don't know anything about anything. The only thing the story added is a name, a short story and the fact that the spirit of Yamoshi is somehow involved on the ritual. Maybe the ritual is something that already existed and Yamoshi just made Beerus and that Namekian learn about it, maybe SSGod is something that existed already and Yamoshi just helps you get it when you do the ritual, maybe it's something his spirit does but then Vegeta also was touched by his spirit during the ritual...

Never underestimate the power of the scout's code
That's revisionist. The only reason missed fgs are considered big mistakes is because of how visible they are. You can't quantify what *small mistakes* cost the teams points usually. But I can think of actually three plays in the Falcons game that swung the win probability that had nothing to do with Walsh.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 1. Jeremy Lane drops a pick on the Hawks 1 Falcons score next play. -7 points _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 2. Russell fumble for six. -7 points _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 3. Whoever the lineman was that missed the fake fg block. -7 points.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Yet here we are trying to crucify *at best* the 4th most egregious pt swing in the game with Walsh's -3. That's called scapegoating. 
Same. I was able to turn down a job offer I wasn't excited about and wait for the right one. That kind of financial freedom is invaluable.

Like I said, a lot of chrysler guys on allpar think that the 300/charger were a mistake being RWD and that they should return to the glory days of cab forward FWD cars like the Concorde. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I wish I were making that up, but no. I'm totally not. XD They think nobody will want a RWD full size sedan.

So you complain when they ignore a civil war, and then complain when a new administration *does* intervene in a civil war. I see.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;More likely the intervention was needed by the West for reasons of self-interest, including opening Libya up to facilitate the travel of economic migrants into Europe. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ So destabalize the route for migrants and make it impossible to track their inflow and keep their legal statuses documented where you could create a tax base so you could instead create a completely chaotic situation where you get far fewer of the benefits of migration, all while bearing far greater costs because of the need to provide emergency services and military intervention. Yeah, that *totally* makes sense.

I agree with cutscene story, it really enriches the game without changing anything about the gameplay. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Maybe even told through Galnet video news stories. *LIVE FROM PLEIADES, I'M BLICK MARGON. AND THIS, COMMANDERS, IS A THARGON.*
Because 90% of the time that is the correct read based on the defenses reaction. Haskins is a good passer, but he misread most of the option calls when he was in which is why they went to mostly called RB runs late (which I think they should call more of when JT is in despite his correct reads on the option plays) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Edit: spelling
I don't think naturally getting to that level through just playing the game normally is called grinding. Pretty contradictory to expect that when they throw enough trainers at you to level you up to 60 by that fight. Also I'm pretty sure the ultra wormhole spawns are all level 60. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ And yes, I didn't actually grind. At least not intentionally. Most of the xp I got were from trainer battles..
Let's just not talk about the heavy cherry-picking you just did, but go back to my main point. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I never said what is right or wrong, you just said that the research was conclusive and I showed you that it definitely isn't. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ You are living in a echo-chamber that feeds you *scientific* arguments that fit with your narrative. This leads you to not even be open to the possibility that you might be wrong. I have done my fair bit of research on both sides and come to a conclusion, you don't even know the other side exists. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Oh well, but as said, I'll never change your mind, so thanks for the talk and have a nice life!

I graduated High School with a similar GPA and make a decent amount of money myself. I completely agree that you can be self-made through community college and ingenuity, but these ostentatious *2.7 GPA* license plate people probably aren't self-made like us.
Yeah, they got contacted and told not to do it again because it set a bad example. Twitch didn't want that 'message' on their site. No real consequences as I recall.
That was my understanding also.  That company was not following the weird laws Canada has in place and that company(and any others operating how they were) are all being shut down. Still plenty of Kratom in Canada though.

If you're not audited, you never have to do anything. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If you're audited, you give whatever records you have to the auditor, and they decide if they believe you or not. So it's up to you to decide how you want to convince them. Why would you give them private keys though? A signed message should be more than enough.

I've done 450 attack missions including defenses and the fortress medals from that pretty much paid for the 5 star on my naruto and 3 star on sarada/sasuke and sakura. I was able to auto battle all of the advanced missions after the 4th day so it wasn't hard to farm, just became choice. I upgraded a bunch of my cards from 2-3 and 3-4 with all being maxed. My naruto is only that high cause i have 2 rasengans and most of the ability upgrades. I'm f2p btw, only pulled 2 5's; with most of my pulls being 2 stars.

yeah, depends on the game. It just depends.
I'm picturing you giving the flap a reassuring little *there there* pat as you put it back in place, thank you for the delightful mental image.

imo, for a bus system, just go with something like: 3-4 iron [produce gears where needed], 2 copper, 1 steel, 1-2 green, 1 red.  Once you get to logistics bots, the bus becomes less and less needed. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ have a plan from the start for room for 3-4 iron smelting areas, where the ore will enter, etc..  a little planning goes a long way. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Also, if things start to feel too spaghetti, that is the time to tear something down to make nicer.  Do that and you'll make it! _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If you're at your wit's end, its not too bad to look at someone else's base to see how they designed it - you'll probably find things that are 'duh' once you see them.
My effective tax bracket goes down 9% under this bill. My sister is a teacher, her tax rate goes down 3%, but with the doubling of the standard deduction she will save a ton. My parent's tax rate also goes down 9%, but he currently itemizes, his quick back of the napkin math shows that with the doubled standard deduction he won't need to itemize (saves a huge headache) and will just about break even. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I'm using numbers from this NPR article: _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ https://www.npr.org/2017/11/02/561639579/chart-how-the-tax-overhaul-would-affect-you _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I'm sure there's cases of people who itemize who are going to see increased taxes, but my family and I are going to do well.

&gt; you keep on talking about the bubble as if it's the most amazing thing in the world. it only adds 2k hp. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The bubble is actually a lot more effective than you might think. I tried out 7‚òÖ Eiko on Fenrir, and before using the bubble Mistair would die to Fenrir's non-elemental magic attack; however, with the bubble up she took almost no damage. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Overall I am very impressed with Eiko after her enhancements. Of course, a Reraise would be great, but she is fantastic as a support/summoner unit now.

(Included in price)  _back_to_line_ Always use magic or lucky tools _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The higher your gathering level the less energy you use. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Also rough stone and logs that nobody sells because it‚Äôs so much more valuable than the market price _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I think it‚Äôs worth it to gather just to get rough stone and logs.

Wolf spiders carry their egg sacs. These look more like those of *Steatoda,* a kind of cobweb spider. But they look old - the spider may have been isolated and laid duds. The crispy spiders look like prey -- the eaten, not the eater.
Agree with B-ryyes statement playing mechanically intense champions is NOT the way to go at all. Play something simpler that requires less conscious thought about each ability so you can focus on playing the map.
Just as a hint, Abjuration is a pretty bad school to take as an enemy school - it has Mage Armour, a staple from lv 1 (although at very early levels you can use it from scrolls), shield (another staple, although only later on when you do not rely on lv 1 slots too much), Dispel Magic (Always useful somewhere), and various elemental resist spells - all very useful in most campaigns. It's not a lot of spells, but they are really amazing ones.

And was it good for both of u? Average? I'm just speaking for me, but I used to fuck a kinda roommate of mine, and the sex was great, it was purely sexual, we couldn't date, but I know the sex was so good that I got to the point where I couldn't wait to be alone with him so we could just fuck. So if it was really good, the chances of it happening again are pretty high.

A friend of mine who is a MEM told me he was training at the Detroit store and some guy ran in, hid in receiving, bleeding out of a gunshot wound while the gunman looked around the store for him, flailing the weapon. There's more to it but it's very grim so I'd rather not say. This was earlier this year. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 24 hr armed guard, parks by the employee cars.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ My DM has a new truck and when he went down there they stole the tires right off the car in less than 5 minutes. They now have a metal gate, locked at night and all.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It's not a good store.
What?  I don't even know how they could make that work as an ultimate. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I think it would be more like Rexxar &amp; Misha.  His turret would be an ability, but a lot of his power level would be in his turret.  Something like E turret, #1 focus turret target (much like Gazlowe) and then W for Armor Packs and Q for close range shotgun blast.  Ult would be either always available Molten Core like Tracer with upgrades at 10 or just Molten Core + another.
Idk bro

I'm not with OP in that I don't trust them but people that draw a hard line on the topic are a little weird to me. Often, I've heard people say something similar to what you have. There's just something a bit off. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It's not like sober and frat-party-black-out-drunk are the only options. When my buddy and I grab a couple after work we are in no danger of doing something stupid. You can drink and not get drunk. I would say that's how most people are. But some people get very black and white about it. It becomes part of their identity. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It's like somebody drawing same type of line with ice cream because it will make you fat and get diabetes. You can have a couple servings now and again and it's fine. There's no reason to so binary.

You're being downvoted by people who haven't watched him play. If Iowa's playcalling and offensive line can get their heads out of their asses, Stanley will be something truly special for the Iowa program.

what type of players are more likely to use recruit chat: casuals or players that want to do specific long runs? I'll give you a hint: it isn't casuals. So why are you expecting casuals to use recruit chat, when they aren't the ones looking for something specific? your ignorance is incredible _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I like how in your world, playing a mission for an hour straight, yielding no extra reward for doing so, is a play style people should cater to....

I guess I should have explained the why in addition to the what. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Wood has long fibers that are bundled together. A common analogy is a bundle of drinking straws. If you have a mass of wood, the strength of the fibers adds up to give structural strength. So wood is strong against any force trying to cut across the fibers (side grain). But it is weak (relatively) against forces that separate fibers from one another (end grain). _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ When you cut a mortise, you are removing a section of fibers. As the removed section grows, the remaining fibers have less support. They may then break at a random point. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ By starting the mortise at both ends you ensure that the ends of your mortise holes are precise an that the fibers removed last are in the middle. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The half-way doesn't have to be precise. Even a deep knife wall on one side might be sufficient.

That‚Äôs what happened here. They called it a ‚Äúsplit precinct‚Äù. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;One of the solutions is that people have talked about is ‚Ä¶ legislation that would prohibit ‚Äòsplit precincts.‚Äô That means a polling place could only have voters voting in one house or congressional district ‚Ä¶ We can also look at technology by which we are assigning voters to specific districts. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If they had set it up so that each precinct was limited to just one districts then there would have been no problem. Every voter at that polling place would have had the correct ballot and it would have been trivial to catch anyone in the wrong place.

It is relevant, if Argentina had a zero tolerance policy for cheating, and Suarez actually ran a risk cheating, he would not have handballed. Anything short of ruining the players career in response is a tacit endorsement of cheating. _back_to_line_ If the head coach of the Yankees ran out on the field to catch a pitch and throw it into the stands, he won't be coaching for much longer _back_to_line_ People miss pks, and the likelihood of missing a place is greater than the ball suddenly stopping at the goal line. The bottom line is that Ghana would have won if Suarez had not cheated. _back_to_line_ In football, players are allowed to use their hands to block scoring passes. It's the equivalent of an outfielders grabbing a ladder from a helicopter to stop a 400 yard home run, ejecting the outfielder, then making the batter hit another home run on the last strike of the game. _back_to_line_

Tin roof, the Woody. I may be being unfair because I am not originally from SC, so the wedding/event music theme of the Woody ends up skewing country to my ears.

WoTS 4 is the best one to start with imo. It's much more polished (as in, less janky) than the previous ones and contains lots of small, quality of life improving things that simply weren't present in the previous iterations, such as showing you the possible things you can do at the current point in the story and what ending they help lead to.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Also, a pro-tip from me: For the best, most organic difficulty progression, start the first playthrough on Easy and play two or three first ones on that difficulty as well. The game is balanced in such a way that the Normal difficulty expects you to already have a custom sword with decent damage output right from the beginning, and that's something you can't achieve very quickly. Learned all that the hard way and I want to save you unnecessary frustration. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ EDIT: Also, if you want more tips, don't hesitate to ask. They might, figuratively of course, save your life one day.

That is a 3rd world problem, so why would any company in Australia inflict that on their employees?    _back_to_line_    _back_to_line_ Bitcoin is not viable as a currency today due to volatility.    _back_to_line_     _back_to_line_ Bitcoin is based on blockchain, but the benefits of blockchain when implemented widely across society are unlikely to have any relationship to Bitcoin.

IANAL but have worked in DAs offices. The DA probably will be adding restitution and the complainant will probably never see a dime of it, especially considering that BIL is a drug addict.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ OP, your BIL might be facing what looks like a large sentence, but if he pleads guilty it is possible he will do very little or even no time at all, instead serving whatever your state's version of intensive probation is. Please prepare yourself for that outcome, I have dealt with too many families who expected the max sentence to be handed out, and only in very severe or extreme cases does that happen. If you want further clarity you should be able to call the DAs office and find out who the Prosecutor is who is representing the State in this matter and find out what a typical outcome in this scenario looks like.

&gt;I suspect that most of.your objections stem from things that are mostly cultural and not religious. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Actually, it's completely the opposite.

It's not anything I would describe as *fun*, but with the growing influence of Islam in the world today it may serve you to take your time and have a read through the [Qur'an](https://quran.com/). You can do it over a year or 10 years, but I will bet money that you will come out with a completely different opinion and perspective on the matter. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Have a great evening.

curious, why did you assume my mother in law is non-wealthy? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ and i have no idea what her thoughts are on medicare or social security. wasn't really a campaign topic. most of her blurbs were about Mexicans in California ruining the state she grew up in and well muslims.  she's really bought into the ISIS angle.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ also, i said she was highly educated, i never said i believe she's highly intelligent.
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the house, but thanks for you advice. _back_to_line_

I don't have an official source and all I could find were random articles and message board topics.  However, I lived and worked in Japan for nearly 5 years, and would see it occasionally.  It was explained to me by several native Japanese people.  It's not super common, but I'd say it's more accepted there than in the US. The law states that married couples must share the same last name, so that is likely why.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Here is a forum discussion about it from years ago: https://www.jref.com/forum/threads/japanese-surnames-after-marriage.27609/ _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Here is a more recent article about the law and moves to repeal it: http://www.refinery29.com/2017/11/180886/japan-marriage-last-name-tradition
Your right but they were part of the human alliance (I did mention that archers were human)
Where did I say they should be forced to stop saying it?
Kind of, but like the area of impact would be greater. It could be like a charging weapon. Maybe some types could like take longer to charge but fire two lobs at the cost of speed, etc. Maybe the actual projectile of the gun would be more like a sub bomb instead of a regular shooter (but that might be too difficult with motion controls). Idk it was just a random thought I had, like how brellas were introduced, maybe a new class would be introduced in Splatoon 3

I didn't intend to make that seem like a joke.  I'm real as hell.  Comedians are to trolls like a mongoose is to a cobra.  Republicans are no different than the drunk asshole at a comedy club who wants to talk during a set, comedians have lots of practice with dealing with those people.   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I'm basically repeating what you just said but it should be repeated.

To be fair, it's not like many of the prophets of Abrahamic faiths would have Genius.  You could give Jesus most of the Virtues and maybe Celibate (I don't think we have a 'peacemaker' trait), but I don't think he qualifies for Genius.
And we all know that no way in hell is that happening. They cant just cut their losses and scrap and everything, its too late.

I don't know what situation was before 1991, but most Russian thinks that there were many criminals before 1991 (in 1980-1990), and they were arrested with help of Putin. It seems to be true for me too. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ So, on the one hand, if there are less criminals, we don't need a strong police, right? But on the other hand, government pays more and more money for increasing police every year. Does it mean that we are more threatened by them? I'm not sure. But I see that opposite politicians have problem with them, and I see some regulations of freedom in the Internet by government. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I feel that my nation is threatened by legal system, but I'm not sure about comparison with 1991.
Yes. Look it up, you've probably seen many examples of it over time. KONY 2012 is probably the most infamous, but the Susan G. Komen foundation and many other fake charities are guilty of it too.
Thanks. You are too kind (for once)

The first couple arcs in Worm were nearly enough to make me drop it-- I knew that bullying like that occasionally happened, but the sheer amount of dysfunction and pathology that tons of characters in Worm display is a bit too much. But since shards like people with dysfunction there's a perfectly good in-universe reason for lots of people in Worm to be screwed up. 
I tried to stick to doing one thing at a time before, I found that I was stuck in deciding which one to do first, I jumped between them and ended up doing nothing again. I'm gona try again though.

Alcoholism is a disease. However that doesn‚Äôt mean you are forced to listen to it. Someone may not drink  but still be an alcoholic. So no, an alcoholic isn‚Äôt necessarily a drunkard. 
Thanks so much for your kind words. I'm very sorry for your loss too - even though as you say the losses aren't the same, the feelings must be similar. I love dogs and cats and I'm sure in many ways I would benefit from a pet but the place I'm currently living in isn't really suitable - it's about the size of a shoebox and has no garden. Plus, my health is such I would worry that I might not be able to look after an animal properly - I could be wrong &amp; really surprise myself but I'm reluctant to take the chance with a living creature.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ My brother's 3 children have the ability to take me out of myself - it's hard to feel down with them around!  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I think my poor health has really got in the way of the grieving process - I guess the two have made each other worse. It's so hard to know which *hurt* to attend to first, sometimes!  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I'll check out meetup.com. I feel pleased that I've made a start in getting out &amp; about.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Thanks again - look after yourself. It's a hard road indeed, but I guess every human being has to walk it at some point in their lives. _back_to_line_

OK, what are you asking for more? It has became a symbolic thing if it's going to be in the upper house. You're asking for quotas according to the population rates exactly? Are you aware that that would mean we possibly getting more than 1:3 rate since the current population ratios? We had let go off the quotas in the real parlaiment and we're gonna have some symbolic one in the upper house, I mean, what you can expect more? Let go off everthing and be a unitarian state all over? Sure, it would have been cool, but since the things have happened, we're for asking checks and balances. I guess it's fair, isn't it? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Turkey will always have reasons for Cyprus, but also for Thrace, Adjara and more. They won't get it.

Ah, if you want mountain lion stories and that impresses you... _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ my best friend's house is new and modern, so it has a TON of glass, and these great big floor to cieling glass doors in the rear of the house, overlooking the redwoods down to the ocean.

I like it!  The Vlad at the back gives decent protection, and the buildings at the back might be just enough to distract Ronin.  The other nice thing is the split of Army camps - the 3 at the back are the usual ones to drop Ronin to hit, but the one at the front is going to be tough for him to break through that Vlad.

Look at the US occupation of Iraq, US soldiers had to hide in *green zones*, assasinations, attacks, car bombs, aggression, terror attacks, hate, hostility, US soldiers had to hide away from the public. They were treated as true invaders and occupiers by the general public.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Syrian soldiers or any Syrian was able to freely walk through safely, liked, welcomed and appreciated all over Lebanon without a problem. The large majority of Lebanese supported Syrian presence and so did the Lebanese Lahoud Government, and Harriri supported the Lahoud Government btw., and even there extension. Because Hariri supported the extension of the Syrian friendly Government, he angered and publicly embarassed France and Saudi Arabia, whom were against the extension of the Syrian friendly Government, which is what actually led to his death.

Do you mean the pak files? I think they‚Äôre special in that they can be used without ‚Äúunpacking‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know how that works - maybe there‚Äôs an index and the PlayStation can request specific files using it and then the pak management controller is able to pull them into memory. No idea! _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ What I meant with the duplicates is this: the base files have to always be present but when the game requests a specific file (say xyz.pak), the PlayStation first checks the game‚Äôs updates directory to see if it‚Äôs there. If it is, it loads it otherwise it loads the exact same file from the base directory. What I don‚Äôt understand is why they keep the base file since it will never be used if the updates file exists. Maybe the base files are used as an index instead of having to manually create an index (or manifest). It‚Äôs stupid though because on installation, a manifest could easily be generated on-the-fly. That way, updates could remove the old file, thus saving space. The only other reason for keeping the old files would be to roll-back updates but there‚Äôs no such feature - or at least that feature is not directly available to the user.

We can't see what mechanical issues he has to fix until we see him get a good amount of live snaps. We need a complete team around him to see his potential. It's also good because it's officially end game for the Pace rebuild. If we don't see any improvement next year he's gotta go.

*Dear SE, I am currently sitting at rank no 1 with 291 Omega kills but would appreciate it if you could ban the hackers in the tower. Please see my photo which shows the current number 2 player who has hacked in this tower and you should ban them if you are a competent company. As you can see at 251 kills they did not run a sub deck which would be impossible for them to proceed &amp; also they clear floors in less than a minute whereas it should take around 15 minutes at this high level. I trust that you actually care about your legitimate players who support this game and that you will take action as for every hacker left in the tower this forces out hard working honest players from achieving the top 500. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Thank you, ‚ÄòLord‚Äô aka Justin.* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ After this are some screenshots he posted as proof _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ All credit for this quote goes to Lord (obviously)
Call me paranoid, but is there a chance that some of the investors on the chat are planted? I am reading the entire thing and there's an strangely high amount of zeal and optimism being expressed by a lot of people. Maybe it's just natural hype and I'm overthinking things.

Anytime!  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I'd include the following sections: _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Objective Statement - declares your goal of obtaining an entry level position in IT as you have possess foundational knowledge in it. HOWEVER, make sure this turns into a summary section in three years once you have work experience. Most people disagree with me when it comes to applications. From my experience, objective statements work for those with little experience. A summary is suited once you have about three years of experience.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Work Experience - Only include most relevant. If all you have is pizza hut or comparable, don't sweat it. List it and include all of your EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE skills, as help desk is very customer service oriented.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Education - Outline graduation dates, awards, schools, and relevant coursework.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Skills - This is going to be very helpful for you. If youre familiar with Active Directory or (list technology here), then literally say one of the following: _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Proficient in (Insert technology here) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Or  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Familiar with (Insert technology here) _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ This will allow you to include your relevant sand boxing while conveying to the hiring manager your skill set and where you could fit in their organization.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Hope this helps.

I only had 2mg once.. and that was under my tongue from a guy that didn't tell me. (I bought 175mcg.. he thought he was being nice giving me lots more for free.) I ended up with a $1200 hospital bill because people called the cops on me. My best trips were around 0.5mg. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ - _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I remember being a single cel organism on an asteroid, floating around in space. I divided into two.. then four.. then eight, etc. It was really difficult to keep track of all my parts once I started becoming more complex. Once I was the asteroid, I just snapped back in confusion. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ - _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I was also Dale Ernhardt stuck in a time loop, continually existing between two seconds and milliseconds before impact. That was fairly stressful. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ - _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Another time I tried to jump through a wall because I was convinced that I was in a dream and it didn't matter. The wall stunned me and I ended up wandering around, confused, until I came to on the other side.. which only reinforced me belief that I was in a dream. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ - _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Oh, and when the cops were called on me.. I thought the world had ended. There were tanks and soldiers and explosions and the sky was blood red. Then, I died and in the afterlife I was chained to a something flat.. and everything was pitch black; no light existed.. and evil spirits would occasionally manifest around me, trying to coerce me into giving up my secrets. Then the amphetamines the ER shot into me kicked in. Once the clock on the wall stopped moving, I looked around and asked WTF was going on and why was I strapped to a bed. The doctors asked me a few questions, but I just claimed to not know what was happening. They said they couldn't find any reason for my behavior in my toxicology reports and wrote it off as a psychotic episode. Then I caught a ride home and went to bed.

This! I recently got back into vaping because I slipped back into cigarettes after I thought I'd managed to quit, and I'm loving the current market. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I started with CE5 clearomizers, but quickly went up to 510 spinners, then my first 50w box mod. That was 4 years ago now. Currently I'm using an Eleaf iKonn 220 with a Limitless XL, a Pulse 24 and a Peerless; XL for outside, 24 and Peerless for home. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ A full kit nowadays costs like $50 as you said, and that's mid-high shelf shit! Top shelf is mostly for exclusivity and fashion. Getting into dripping nowadays is also super easy, considering there are tons of companies making premade coils, and that there are tons of youtube channels like Rip Trippers, Mike Vapes, Ruby Roo, telling you exactly what to do in each and every review as well as their tutorials! _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If clouds isn't your fancy, check out DashVapes' newest video about the MTL tank by pbusardo. It's just come out, and it's the high-shelf experience, but with a cigarette style draw. Dope right?? I'm definitely getting one as soon as I pick up my next paycheck.

ah. well, if you're not entirely averse to strategy games, there's a game called 'Oriental Empires' that you might enjoy. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ it leans more towards the Grand Strategy style of games, but it's much lighter than say Crusader Kings or Hearts of Iron.

Yeah the current state is a bit weird but they went with it as it is. Operation cinder is suppose to destroy the empire from within itself and I think that is very visible.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Some people who are undeniably loyal to the late emperor and gave their life for it stay with it until the ship sinks to the bottom and some people like Iden weren‚Äôt brainwashed enough. If you‚Äôve read inferno squad book (which I loved) you can see a glimmer of betrayal in what Iden says and does throughout the book. After reading it I knew she would eventually deflect especially if the empire was going to attack her home planet Vardos. She never liked her father but wanted to be a good and the best soldier.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ But coming back to Luke now you say it like that, yes he could‚Äôve avoided them and I‚Äôd would have better suited his character I agree. But I think for the narrative of the game and gameplay they went with this and showed the humanity of him in the cutscenes. I personally really liked how he talked to Dell and always gave him a answer that was a question that would make him rethink what has always been imprinted on him.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I just wish we could have a full on Luke skywalker campaign of him exploring the galaxy for Jedi stuff and getting hunted or finding trouble on the way
I agree with everything you say about Navy.  Afterall, im in the military myself (air force).   _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It does make me proud to see the service academies do well.

As someone who served in the army I think you've confused yourself as to its demographics. While it does tend to lean to the right I wouldn't claim the army is filled with religious wackos or extremists. Not but a long shot. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ We never defeated the insurgency in Iraq so not sure where you got that one from. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ America has yet to win a single guerilla war. Our military is good at fighting uniformed forces but not guerillas. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The idea you think you could just label someone a liberal and soldiers would happily kill them shows how delusional you are. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The reference to Obama killing an American citizen was because he became a terrorist and then filed into a theatre of war where we were currently engaged. Not sure I agree with it but that's a farm cry from asking soldiers to go door to door killing everyone in Los Angeles for example. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 
When you're part of a union it's almost impossible to fire someone in Canada. Only person I know that got fired was someone tried to hit someone else with their car not like going fast but enough to hurt the person, she got a 2 or 3 week suspension I can't remember but without pay and she tried to sue the company. After the courts agreed she was at fault and deserved the suspension my company fired her. So you really have to try your hardest if you want to get fired where I work lol

I think why it is deemed op is because you constantly have to pay attention (which is highly demanding considering this is a strategy game). On top of that, its stat is crazy af too. At lv14 it‚Äôs 225dps/2000hp each. 
Which one?
no doubt, i agree
r/furry_irl
also true, she's a good unit to use right now with her double hand, but will not reach big damage for a long time. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ So, while she should replace chizuru, the OP should still be looking for another DPS that's easier to build to use while farming and looking for the TMs she needs.
I have now. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If they really have accomplished what they claim, this is big. They've somehow come up with a way to interpolate HRIRs for arbitrary source locations, not just a handful of fixed points. That's HUGE. The catch is they need applications to drive their algorithm with a purpose-made API feeding it with arbitrary sound positions for it to have any edge over current HRTF solutions. Looks like they've already got the API, they just need to get people to use it. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ That... I dunno. The vast majority of games are still doing simple, naive mixdowns with at best simplistic reverb effects applied. The industry first needs to be convinced that the audio stack actually deserves a little thought. By that time, they may have competition as other (probably bigger and older) outfits come up with similar algorithms, and likely many of them will work with any old headphones, giving Ossic a serious disadvantage.
Now, I'm top mod. Yeah, it's a real (riches to) rags to riches story. Just haven't gotten around to doing it.

There‚Äôs a prevalent mindset that they support aiding the refugees, but not in their backyard.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Also the White Paper 2011 created a lot of opposition to the current ruling party because of the planned increase in population size of 6.9m by 2030 from 5.1m at the moment. Taking in more people is highly unpopular considering the failing and increasingly unreliable train system which was only intended for a population of 3-4m. Thus there‚Äôs no rationale to take in refugees here when the strain of an increased population is hitting Singapore heavily now. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Edit: it is written in the constitution that a balanced budget must be achieved by the Singapore Government so with surpluses used to increase the scarce number of hospital beds and stimulate the economy, I don‚Äôt see an avenue for a refugee expenditure to be spent

There was a genuine lack of data, not that there was no data, but not enough to make a hard call. We can't criticize them for telling the truth here, but we can criticize them for not having acted much, much sooner on creating data gathering services. What needs to be mentioned is that foreigners only account for about [5% of purchases](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/bc-government-releases-preliminary-data-on-foreign-home-purchases/article30790277/), which is meaningful enough to have an impact but ~75% of the price increases are being driven by local *market fundamentals*. If you could somehow block all foreign buyers you'd only see a ~14% change in the price increase. While Robertson deserves blame, it's for not acting to loosen supply-side restrictions, curbing local speculative demand and extending transit outside of the city.

No, I'm saying the reasons are bull. First, understand that those reasons are there from January 2015. They wrote all those reasons as if they already achieved it. It's classic bragging writing by Ad Schellevis from OPNsense, he also wrote the *drama* piece about opnsense.com. So let's analyze: _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt; Technical / code quality _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ OPNsense broke almost every feature pfSense had. Including making pfSense packages not work. They claimed they did it for code quality yet current OPNsense codebase consists mostly of hacks and patches. They broke VLAN's over 5 times. Breaking VLAN's in product you claim to be production ready is just unacceptable. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;Security _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ For security they point out how they believe the GUI should not run as root but what they don't tell you that GUI *still* runs as root in OPNsense. They never fixed that and never will. Speaking of security, starting today OPNsense is running an end of life FreeBSD version. And if that wasn't bad, they tried to downplay or hide the fact they had MANY critical CSRF vulnerabilities. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;Quality _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I cannot accept the fact that broken VLAN's show of code quality. I just can't _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;Community _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ This one is a real gem. They forked pfSense and claimed they have community. They literally had non existing community for a long time. These days is mostly just Franco's minions (main dev) who eat all the bull he serves them _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;Transparency _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ They claim to be transparent yet they hide vulnerabilities or run a closed source *Supported Edition* of OPNsense. Their literally said *Since Netgate bought the majority share of pfSense and renamed the company to ESF it has been difficult to understand the direction they want the project to go*. Pure propaganda. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ &gt;Restore a firm open source project _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ This one is also hilarious. Since their day one they first claimed pfSense is not open source. A pfSense fork claiming pfSense is not open source. Then they said *not true* open source because pfSense had ESF license, almost identical as Apache one. Now pfSense has Apache 2.0 license but OPNsense still did not change their views.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The whole *about the fork* page just shows how malicious they are.

&gt; Being anti-Trump is not a qualification for being a good candidate.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ No it's not... who's saying it is? Being a politician with values that align with the Democratic Party is a qualification for being a candidate. Unsurprisingly, that also likely means they don't like Trump. You're making a weird causal assumption here that doesn't exist. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_

We've tried a lot of different things. Many antidepressants can be used to treat neuropathy, but finding the right combination can be tricky. Currently gabapentin (an anti-seizure drug - I never had seizures) and duloxetine (an SSRI - I have no problems with depression) in combination, in low doses, are doing a great job, even though either one by itself doesn't work very well, even at relatively high doses. Drug interactions can be weird. Some can be weirdly good.

I like pvp so I guess I'll just keep doing that, Rival Wing games tend to give decent exp and ends relatively quickly.
We're asked to model ourselves after God, right? He's our father, not in a figurative sense. Mormons believe he's literally our father - an old, glowing white dude who sees us individually as his children.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ If you're a parent, try to relate to this man. Imagine you cranked a few billion spirit children and you're all hanging out up on Kolob. According to LDS belief, the general plan is 1. go to Earth to learn how to be a decent human and get a body, 2. return to live to God in heaven.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Steps 1 and 2 seem OK. Can we stop there? Nope. We need a massive bureaucratic process shoehorned in between, steps 1a-1q.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Deep breath: _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Adam comes to Earth to get the first body and must sin to fall from grace so that he and Eve can learn good from evil and once they are fallen they cannot return to God because no unclean thing can dwell in his presence requiring a savior to come and die for all mankind's sins allowing them to return if they do certain things such as be baptized and learn important handshakes in a temple and don't have sex outside of marriage or masturbate or drink beer and God will help you find lost keys but not recover from cancer which makes it pretty fucking hard to trust that anything a church says about him is real, and if you didn't have the chance to learn the important handshakes [yeah!] someone who is alive can do them in your place and you can accept them up in heaven as if you learned them in person and when you reach the pearly gates you can shake hands with Jesus, now a perfect person who can dwell with God because you didn't masturbate too much...but even if you did you get in because you repented, which only works because Jesus died for you, and you're pretty lucky anyway because 1/3 of God's children are already eternally doomed because they didn't like the idea of the above pile of tripe when it was presented to them and rebelled before it even kicked off.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Something like that.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ OR, a more logical God might have said: _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ *Kids, go to Earth, learn to be good people and come back when you're not a shithead. If you're a shithead, you don't get in for X amount of time, but hopefully you eventually learn to not be a shithead and come back to me. Love, Dad.*
I get everything you're saying. I appreciate your input.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ But why is this so? In theory if someone could time the market, there really is no limit to how much they could make. 1000%, 2000%, or more, per year, if they won every single trade. But what about someone who has 3/4 good trades?  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It's just crazy to me that stocks have patterns in them from time to time but people still can't get it right (including me).

&gt; imo, seeking out the sounds that you like and want to hear on the fretboard is the best form of ear training. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Absolutely, figuring stuff out instead of trying to memorize the sound of intervals. That way you're not just practising your ear, but also relating your ear to the fretboard and your fingers, developing your playing at the same time. It also keeps it interesting and fun, unless you enjoy drilling intervals into your brain

React to the kick itself not the dodge. Is you dodge on their dash they'll just double dash. Wait until orange fire to dodge, if the Shinobi is dumb they'll commit the heavy anyway and it's an easy parry. If they're smart they'll back flip. If you have a lunge attack or orochi with riptide strike (and maybe storm rush? You can punish kick. Otherwise kick is unpunishable if he black flips.

The first dress is adorable, but you will not want to wear a blazer or cardigan over that due to those ruffle off the shoulder sleeves. It will bunch in the sleeves of the blazer/cardigan and be uncomfortable and has the potential of looking bulky. I like be second dress. It‚Äôs a little more appropriate, but gives you a sense of youthfulness with that cute cross back. Just be mindful of how short it is.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Velvet is always a nice choice of fabric holiday parties. When choosing your outfit, just be cautious of how short the dress is, and how much skin your showing since it is a work event. Also, as corny as it is, it is always better to be over dressed than underdressed. The type of work setting you are from makes a difference too. I‚Äôve noticed that often times different work places have different ideas on what they consider ‚Äúcasual yet smart.‚Äù  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ You can always see if there‚Äôs photos from last years holiday work party. That way you can get a better sense of what people wore to help inform your decision some.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ How that helps.

Ah. Okay. Then I've got a story to tell you about toplane. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Toplaners are responsible for four things, roughly in this order as the game goes on: _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_     Get first turret in the game. _back_to_line_     Get Rift herald. _back_to_line_     Teleport to bot when a fight starts. _back_to_line_     Splitpush. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Not having teleport means you are unable to do 50% of your job (the two last ones). There are a few toplaners like Gangplank or Pantheon who can get by without teleport, because of their ults. But not Morde. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ In addition to this, you are also telling your opponent: *Here. Here is an extra experience level. I want to fight you when you are level 6 and I am level 5.* _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Here's why: Let's say you push your opponent into their tower, and they start recalling to buy items. Can you recall now? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ No! Because if you do they will immediately TP back, clear the wave, and get an experience lead. You have to stay in order to maintain your lead, but that makes you vulnerable to jungle pressure since you are essentially farming under *their* turret. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Or, you could freeze the wave under *your* turret, allow them to recall and then clear it while they're buying. Then you will have an experience lead, but they will have more *items* because you haven't backed yet! So that's not good either. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ That's why you always take teleport top.
heh... I like dmgz's point... Maybe you are right and Elliot didn't see the point to hide if he is dead.... BUT... will he remember... _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ On the flip side... Why'd he *wipe* everything else about his computer if his death ultimately makes it pointless? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ 
I can tell you why the etho-nationalists want all ethnicities to go home, wherever that is: _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It is because diversity + proximity = war. It has been this way throughout recorded human history. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ It was just yesterday that there were a couple of threads about that college newspaper OPED that said white genetics were evil. The only people who said things like that five years ago were crazy people like radical black liberation activists and the like. Now you have college students in mainstream colleges across the country saying it. Where do you think things will be in 10 years? 20 years? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Have *any* of you been paying attention to what is happening to white farmers in South Africa? _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Do not make the assumption that such a thing will not happen here in the US. A five time deported illegal immigrant just got away with murder in California after *admitting* he murdered a white lady. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ The way things are going now, there is a bloodbath coming the likes of which humanity has *never* seen. The dividing lines will be race, skin color will be your uniform. It will come in my lifetime. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ And I'm 46.

Probably not, but there could be more evidence out there. Plus, it's a common practice to threaten the most serious charge even remotely possible then plea bargain from there.

Not just for that but for any false accusations Banks made to his massive audience. He should be at least partially responsible for any harm caused by his followers too. Stick a pin in  the *spreading rumors on social media as a means to attack someone* bullshit right now.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_

Thank you so much darlin :*
&gt; there should be no doubt that we can explain the full range or experiences. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ There is a whole category of things that science alone cannot explain. This is known as the [*is-ought gap*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem) -- you cannot derive things that ought to be (like morality) from how things are (what science studies). Science alone cannot tell you how to act ethically. It can give you facts, but it cannot explain how you act upon those facts. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Furthermore, science cannot prove science. Seems obvious, but that means that if you accept science, you have accepted science's philosophic assumptions, which you cannot prove using science or the physical world.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ For example, one of them is the [problem of induction](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/). That is, how do you prove that induction works? You can't just say *well, it's worked really well in the past* -- that's induction, and you can't prove induction by assuming induction. Even if you could prove induction somehow, you can't do it with science, because science assumes induction works. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ Science cannot explain the full range of human experiences. It cannot even explain itself.

I feel like it can be both. On the one hand I don't have the sense that I have much of a range of romantic options, and that certainly doesn't make me want to reject more often. On the other hand I think men are socialized to bear the weight of social problems more than we're socialized to actually resolve them.
Worth a shot
I wouldn't recommend anything too similar haha, ended up giving Mitchell AND D'Lo for Elfrid Payton, too much.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I paid a lot, definitely *lost* in absolute value, but my team is better off for it in my eyes because I got something back for D'lo without dropping him for a competitive team to pick up, open up a spot for streaming, don't have any long-term injured players anymore, and Payton just fits my build a lot more than the other two (I don't need scoring or a good FT, Payton helps my FG and assists).  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ My only regret in the scenario was burning a waiver on D'Lo in the first place but oh well
Yeah, I gotcha. They are people too, and we need to treat them as such. It‚Äôs just weird to either fully worship or completely hate people we haven‚Äôt ever met with no inbetween and drawing such harsh stances, while at the same time flip-flopping on our ‚Äúmorals‚Äù and values constantly, depending on the person. 
Good point. Could always just stress no meat and no cheese due to allergies, I'm sure they'd be happy to abide.
Not quite, exp gain goes faster now even though the cap was doubled. The rate at which you gain not being reduced makes a big difference. I've been talking to many people about how the exp change feels lately.

Yeah, I've play survival exclusively since the overhaul on it way back, and I usually only take just enough Endurance to get Aquaboy/girl on my various playthroughs.  _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ I did one as an ultimate generalist character: started off with just the base SPECIAL and just bought the first level of each available perk. When all those were bought up, I bought up all my SPECIALs by one more dot, bought one level of each of those ranks of perks, etc. I haven't pulled him out in awhile but I think he's up to 5 or 6 in his SPECIALs now and is a killing machine. 
To be fair, we pulled out as the Big East was in full implosion.  Pitt and Syracuse left.  WVU left.  TCU got offered Big 12 instead of Big East/AAC, and it was clear that they were going to raid conference USA to try to stay afloat.  Not to mention that the Big East AQ bid was certain to go away.  It was a dark time for the AAC and I'm impressed as hell how well they've done

I don't mean to be a stickler or anything but life drawings mean typically drawn from life, not from your head or from a book. Not everyone has access to nude models, but you can still find ways to work from life! If you aren't in a class at school right now where life drawing is offered, sit a friend or family member down and sketch them.  You'll also probably want to do a self-portrait, sitting and looking at a mirror. _back_to_line_  _back_to_line_ EDIT: another commenter mentioned this, too -- Depending on where you live, you might be able to drop into a college-level or continuing ed life drawing class at a local university or community college. This will help you enormously and I really recommend you do it.

I don't think he is expected to put his health on the line. It's a unique circumstance given that he did not undergo serious surgery, but rather a 20-30 minute common procedure for elite athletes. It's surprising that he's coming back so soon, but that call is up to the doctors and JT. If he feels fine and they're ok with him playing, then it makes sense. If he gets hurt, their necks will be on the line for sure.
